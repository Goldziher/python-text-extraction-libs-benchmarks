But how do you do? I see I have frightened\nyou--sit down and tell me all the news.\"\n\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna\nScherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With\nthese words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and\nimportance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna\nhad had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la\ngrippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the\nelite.\n\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered\nby a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n\n\"If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the\nprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,\nI shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10--Annette\nScherer.\"\n\n\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the least\ndisconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an\nembroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on\nhis breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that\nrefined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and\nwith the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance\nwho had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna,\nkissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,\nand complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n\n\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's mind\nat rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and\naffected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be\ndiscerned.\n\n\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like\nthese if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You are staying the\nwhole evening, I hope?\"\n\n\"And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I must\nput in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is coming for\nme to take me there.\"\n\n\"I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these\nfestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\n\n\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been\nput off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit\nsaid things he did not even wish to be believed.\n\n\"Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's\ndispatch? You know everything.\"\n\n\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold, listless\ntone. \"What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has\nburnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.\"\n\n","extracted_metadata":{"Content-Encoding":["ISO-8859-1"],"X-TIKA:Parsed-By":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.csv.TextAndCSVParser"],"resourceName":["book-war-and-peace-1p.txt"],"X-TIKA:Parsed-By-Full-Set":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.csv.TextAndCSVParser"],"Content-Length":["3045"],"Content-Type":["text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1"]},"metadata_field_count":6,"attempts":1,"timestamp":1752386753.9640589,"platform":"Linux","python_version":"3.13.5"},{"file_path":"test_documents/text/selected_pdfs.txt","file_size":2374,"file_type":"txt","category":"tiny","framework":"extractous","iteration":0,"extraction_time":0.047330379486083984,"startup_time":null,"peak_memory_mb":392.23046875,"avg_memory_mb":391.38046875,"peak_cpu_percent":62.8,"avg_cpu_percent":12.559999999999999,"total_io_mb":null,"status":"success","character_count":2375,"word_count":337,"error_type":null,"error_message":null,"quality_metrics":{"char_count":2375,"word_count":337,"sentence_count":46,"paragraph_count":6,"avg_word_length":6.029673590504451,"avg_sentence_length":7.913043478260869,"extraction_completeness":1.0,"text_coherence":0.8260869565217391,"noise_ratio":0.0,"gibberish_ratio":0.13924050632911392,"flesch_reading_ease":31.25250179629964,"gunning_fog_index":13.869193461469374,"has_proper_formatting":true,"maintains_line_breaks":true,"preserves_whitespace":false,"table_structure_preserved":false,"format_specific_score":0.0,"expected_content_preserved":false},"overall_quality_score":0.43308736637580936,"extracted_text":"# Selected PDFs for Benchmarking\n\n## Small PDFs (< 100KB)\n1.

He moved to Huddersfield Town in 1990 where he remained\nfor three seasons before transferring to Leicester City. Roberts signed for Wolverhampton\nWanderers after three further seasons, but stayed for a single campaign before transferring\nto Norwich City, where he spent seven years. He played international football for Wales and\namassed fifteen caps between 1989 and 2001, without scoring.\nRoberts made 647 league appearances during his career, almost half of which were for\nNorwich, where he overcame a weak start to become a fan favourite. At his peak, he scored\n61 goals in three seasons, and finished with two goals in his final game as Norwich achieved\npromotion to the Premiership. He was elected to the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame in\n2002, while still at the club. His professional career ended with spells at Gillingham and on\nloan to Cambridge United.\nSince retiring as a player, Roberts, who speaks fluent Welsh, has worked as a commentator\nfor Sky Sports, BBC Radio Cymru and BBC Cymru Wales. His book, All I Want for\nChristmas ..., a reference to his gap-toothed appearance, prompted both controversy and\npraise when it was published in 2004.\nIwan Wyn Roberts was born in Bangor, Gwynedd, on 26 June 1968,[1] and grew up in\nBarmouth, on the west coast of Wales as a Liverpool fan.[2]\nRoberts says that most football fans would know him (\"if you know me at all\") as \"that gaptoothed ginger lunk\".[3] He started losing his front tooth when he was just 10: his best\nfriend's heel chipping half of his tooth off, the result of an incident playing football.[4] Some\nyears later, a dentist removed the stump when an abscess developed.[4] He lost his second\nfront tooth as the result of an elbow to the mouth from Darran Rowbotham when he was\n18,[5]\n playing for Watford in a pre-season friendly.[4]\nEarly life\n2005 â�� Cambridge United (loan) 11 (3)\nTotal 647 (202)\nInternational career\n1989â��2001 Wales 15 (0)\n1994 Wales B 1 (1)\nManagerial career\n2004 Gillingham (joint-caretaker)\n*Club domestic league appearances and goals\nRoberts credits his school PE teacher, Iolo Owen, as a great influence in his career,\nintroducing him into men's football aged 15: \"He picked me for the school team and got me\ninto the local men's team, Harlech Town ... as he was the manager ... it toughened me up\nand made me a lot stronger.\"[6] Critical to Roberts' thinking when he joined Watford was\nthat coach Tom Walley was, like himself, Welsh-speaking, as was professional Malcolm\nAllen, against whom Roberts had played in the local Welsh leagues.[7] He was also\ninfluenced by Graham Taylor's record of giving youth players opportunities.[8] Roberts\njoined Watford as a trainee, signing his first professional contract in July 1986, shortly after\nhis 18th birthday.[9]\nRoberts made his first-team debut during the 1985â��86 season and scored his first goal in professional football on 16 September 1986; it was the\nonly goal in a 1â��0 win against Manchester United at Vicarage Road.\n[10] Having made only one full first team appearance for Watford prior to the\nmatch, Roberts came on as a second-half substitute to score the winning goal from a narrow angle.[11] Watford ended the season in ninth\nposition,[12] and despite having three years of his contract remaining, Taylor left the club to join Aston Villa.\n[13] Roberts broke through in the\nfollowing season, making 31 appearances in all competitions and scoring three goals, but Watford finished 19th in the table and were relegated to\nthe Second Division.\n[14][15] The 1988â��89 season saw him make 32 appearances in total, scoring six goals,[16] with Watford finishing fourth, but\nfailing to progress past the 1989 Football League play-offs.\n[17] Roberts' chances were restricted the following season, when he made just nine\nleague appearances, scoring twice.[18]\nHe scored nine goals in 63 league matches in total for Watford,[19] but felt that he was failing to get enough opportunities and moved to Division\nThree club Huddersfield Town prior to the start of the 1990â��91 season, for Â£275,000.[8][19][20] One of his contemporaries at Watford was future\nNorwich City manager, Glenn Roeder. Roberts remembers Roeder as \"an absolute gentleman ... I can't speak highly enough of him. He helped me\na great deal with his experience and any problems that the young lads had they knew he would help them with.\"[21]\nRoberts credits a lot of his success as a striker to the interaction he had with Huddersfield's then first-team coach, Peter Withe: \"Peter was\nexceptional in the air and he taught me so much on how to use my physicality properly and how to move defenders about especially in the penalty\nbox which would enable me a bit more time and space in the box.\"[22] The club then signed Frank Stapleton, who helped the young Roberts\ndevelop \"awareness in the opposition's penalty box\" and how to \"steal goals\" to increase his goal tally, getting a final touch to 'help' a goalbound\nball cross the line.[22]\nThe 1991â��92 season brought Roberts a club post-war record 34 goals in a season, 24 of which were in the league, making him joint top-scorer in\nthe division.[2][8][23] His efforts helped the club to finish third and qualify for the play-offs.\n[24] There they lost to Peterborough United where\nRoberts failed to score in either leg.[8][25] Overall, whilst playing for Huddersfield he scored 50 goals in 142 games.[26][27][28][29]\nIn November\nClub career\nWatford\nHuddersfield Town\n1993 he was signed by the Second Division club Leicester City for Â£300,000.[19][30] Neil Warnock, Huddersfield's manager, needed to sell players\nand Leicester manager Brian Little took an interest.[31]\nRoberts made his debut for Leicester in a Midlands derby against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n[31] At half time, Leicester were two goals behind\nand he expected manager Brian Little, \"the nicest man\" he ever played for to rant in the dressing room, but instead he quietly told the players he\nwas going to make two substitutions.[32]\nIn the second half, Roberts scored two goals to secure a draw.[32] After retiring, Roberts said he still\nregretted not completing a hat-trick in the match, a feat he did achieve in April 1994, in a 28-minute spell against local rivals Derby County.\n[31] As\nrecently as 2017, this achievement is still recalled in a chant by Leicester City fans.[33] Roberts broke some ribs a few weeks later and returned to\nthe first-team squad just in time for the 1993â��94 play-off final, which Leicester won 2â��1 against Derby.[31]\nIn the 1994â��95 Premiership, Leicester struggled and were relegated, but Roberts was the club's top scorer with 11 goals in all competitions.[31][34]\nHe scored another 19 goals the following season, as Leicester reached the play-offs again.[35]\nIn the semi-final, Leicester drew 0-0 with Stoke City\nin the first leg at home and won 1-0 in the second leg from a Garry Parker goal, to qualify for the final.\n[36] What followed was one of the only two\nincidents that \"bugged\" Roberts during his playing career: while celebrating the win, he suddenly realised he was in danger due to a pitch invasion\nby Stoke supporters.[36] He managed to escape, but some of his team-mates, including Neil Lennon and Muzzy Izzet were less fortunate, and had\nto be protected by police.[36][37] Although it was reported that Roberts had recovered from injury,[38] he was not selected for the squad for the\nplay-off final against Crystal Palace. Leicester won the match which secured them promotion to the Premiership.[35] With the side promoted again,\nLeicester decided to sell Roberts to Wolves.[31] In all, Roberts scored 41 goals in 100 league games for Leicester.[19]\nHis goals and performances for Leicester persuaded Wolves to sign Roberts for Â£1.3m in the summer of 1996.[39] He spent only one season at\nMolineux in which he scored 12 goals in 33 games, including one hat-trick for the club in a match against their local rivals West Bromwich Albion\nin the Black Country derby.\n[39][40] Wolves ended the season in third place but lost 4â��3 on aggregate to Crystal Palace in the play-offs, with Roberts\nfailing to score in either leg.[41]\nIn the summer off-season of 1997, Roberts returned from holiday and came into the club for the first day of pre-season training where manager\nMark McGhee called him into his office. There McGhee said that he had been told that in order to bring in new players, he had to sell first, and that\nRoberts was the only player for whom an offer had been made â�� by Norwich City.[42] Roberts did not want to leave the club, but accepted that if\nthe manager did not want him there, he needed to go.[42]\nIn July 1997, Norwich City manager Mike Walker paid Â£850,000 to Wolves to secure the services of Roberts.[43] His time at the club (nicknamed\nthe Canaries) did not begin happily, however. Following his debut in August 1997 against his former club Wolves, he struggled throughout the\n1997â��98 season and scored just seven goals; \"there were certainly those in the stands who were questioning whether he was worth the near\nÂ£1,000,000 splashed out on him\".[44] There were crowd chants about him being a \"waste of money\" and Roberts remembers that someone wrote\nLeicester City\nWolverhampton Wanderers\nNorwich City\nto the Eastern Daily Press and described him as \"the worst ever to wear a Norwich shirt\", adding the reflection that \"it was the bleakest period of\nall my years as a pro.\"[42] Roberts had scored just four goals heading into the end of the season; however, his fitness slowly began to improve and\n\"three goals in the final two home games of the season left in good heart for the next campaign\".[44] Walker was sacked at the end of the season,\nand Roberts blames himself for this happening â�� a result of his lack of goals.[42]\nWalker was replaced during the summer by Bruce Rioch. During pre-season training, Roberts weighed in at 15 stone 3 pounds (97 kg), with a body\nfat ratio of 16â��17%, when his \"fighting weight\" should have been \"just under 14 stone with around 13 per cent body fat.\"[45] The turnaround was,\naccording to Roberts, due to some clever psychology by Rioch:\n\"Bruce was very clever: he didn't issue me with an ultimatum, he didn't rant and rave or threaten me. He just said, \"Tom Walley would\nbe proud of you\". Tom was my youth team manager at Watford and absolutely hated people being out of shape ... It was a gentle hint,\nbut I realised ... I had to sort it out myself.\"[45]\nRoberts threw himself into weight training and soon reached a target weight of 13 stone 10 pounds.[45]\nIt paid off: that season, Roberts scored 23\ngoals.[44] He was partnered by what the Eastern Daily Press described as the \"flourishing talent\" of Craig Bellamy who scored 19 goals. Norwich\nfinished in the top half of the table and the Canaries fans voted Roberts player of the season.\n[44]\nIn the 1999â��2000 season he was again top scorer\n(19 goals in 49 games) and retained the player of the season award. He just missed out on becoming the first player in the club's history to win the\naward three years in a row when Andy Marshall finished narrowly ahead of him in the voting for the 2000â��01 season.\n[46]\nDuring that 1999â��2000 campaign there was speculation about Roberts's future as his contract was due to expire in the summer of 2000.[47]\nRoberts had an agent, former team-mate and close friend David Speedie, who advised him to turn down Norwich's offer and sign for Nottingham\nForest or Huddersfield Town. Ultimately, \"he couldn't produce anything on paper that told me I'd be signing ... so I could have got injured in\ntraining, never played again and not got a penny.\"[47] As a result, the two men fell out and Roberts did not use the services of an agent again,\nrepresenting himself in contract negotiations.[47] Shortly after he signed a contract extension in January of that season, Bruce Rioch left the club\nand was succeeded by Bryan Hamilton. Roberts helped Hamilton make a good start when he scored both goals in a 2â��0 win at Portman Road\nagainst City's East Anglian derby rivals Ipswich Town on 19 March 2000.[48]\nAlthough Roberts was personally enjoying the most productive spell of his career, his first four years at Carrow Road had seen the club struggle.\nThey had barely threatened to qualify for the end of season play-offs, ending the 2000â��01 campaign in 15th place, six points above the relegation\nzone.[49] The 2001â��02 season, with new manager Nigel Worthington in his first full season in charge,[50] saw the team fare better and they\nreached the Division One play-off final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.\n[51] Roberts missed much of the second half of the season because of\ninjury, but came off the substitute's bench in the final to give Norwich the lead in the first minute of extra-time with a header. Norwich lost the\nmatch in a penalty shoot-out after Birmingham City had equalised. Roberts took â�� and scored â�� the first penalty of the shoot-out but misses by\nPhil Mulryne and Daryl Sutch meant Birmingham won 4â��2 and were promoted to the Premiership.[52]\nDuring the 2002â��03 season, Roberts captained the Norwich team. That season, in a match against Sheffield Wednesday at Carrow Road, Roberts\nscored twice to move into third place on the list of Norwich City's all-time leading goalscorers, overtaking Robert Fleck in the process.[53] The\nCanaries faded after a good start to the season, finishing in eighth place and failing to qualify for the play-offs.[54] Roberts scored just 7 goals in 47\ngames.[55] The 2003â��04 season would be his last at Carrow Road and although he was no longer an regular starter for the first team he played an\nUnder Nigel Worthington,\nRoberts became club\ncaptain, but also finished his\nNorwich City career.\nimportant part in one of the club's best-ever seasons. The team won the title and were promoted to the\nPremiership.[56] Roberts scored some important goals, including the winning strike in a top-of-the-table match\nagainst Sheffield United.\n[57] Roberts revealed in his autobiography that in February of that season he had a cancer\nscare and had to have a malignant melanoma removed from his arm.[58]\nA few days before the club's last home match of the 2003â��04 season, Worthington announced that Roberts would not\nbe offered a new contract when his deal expired that summer. Worthington felt that, following promotion to the\nPremiership, the club had to look to the future and that Roberts was now surplus to requirements.[59] Although he\nhad made 41 league appearances that season, he started just 13 games.[60] With the championship already won,\nWorthington restored Roberts to the starting line-up for the last game of the season at Gresty Road against Crewe\nAlexandra and made him captain for the day. Roberts scored twice as City won 3â��1;[61] he described the occasion and\nthe goal: \"I'd never scored on the final day of a season before, it was my final game in a Norwich shirt, which was a\nvery sad occasion, Nigel Worthington made me captain for the day and I'll be forever thankful for that, and I managed\nto cap it all off by getting two goals. One of them was a left footed volley into the top corner and I haven't got too\nmany of those in my career!\"[2]\n Overall, Roberts scored 96 goals in 306 games for Norwich.[61]\nAfter being released by Norwich, he received a number of offers to play for other clubs, including from Swiss side FC\nBasel, but eventually signed a two-year contract with Gillingham of the Championship, where he would be\nplayer/coach.[59] His debut was against Ipswich, Norwich's local rivals, and was booked after less than five seconds.[5] The move to Gillingham did\nnot prove a good one for him and he had a number of disagreements with the club, particularly with Stan Ternent after he succeeded Andy\nHessenthaler as manager.[5][62]\nIn December 2004 Roberts had himself served as joint caretaker manager, along with Darren Hare and Paul\nSmith, after the sudden departure of both Hessenthaler and initial caretaker John Gorman.\n[5]\nIn March 2005 he joined Cambridge United on loan\nuntil the end of the season to play under the management of former Norwich team-mate, Rob Newman.\n[2] He scored his 200th league goal on his\ndebut,[5] but Cambridge were relegated from League Two.[63] In August 2005, Roberts retired from playing after reaching an agreement with\nGillingham to pay the final year of his contract.[62]\nWhile a Watford player, Roberts was called up for Wales for the first time, an April 1989 friendly game against Israel.\n[64] He made his debut for the\nWelsh national team on 11 October 1989, when he took to the field in a 2â��1 defeat to the Netherlands in a World Cup qualifier at the Racecourse\nGround, Wrexham. With both Ian Rush and Mark Hughes suspended, Roberts started the game alongside Malcolm Allen.[65] He had to wait more\nthan two years for his next international appearance, when his domestic form for Huddersfield saw him leading scorer in Division Two.[23] Roberts\nplayed in a 1â��1 friendly against Austria in April 1992.[66] He earned two more caps that year at the Kirin Cup in Japan, suffering a 1â��0 loss against\nArgentina and receiving a red card in a 1â��0 victory over the host nation for a foul on Masami Ihara.\n[66][67] Roberts made three appearances for the\nsenior Wales team in 1994, including two qualification matches for UEFA Euro 1996 against Albania and Moldova.\n[66] He was not selected for\nWales again until 2000 when he made three appearances in friendlies, all losses against Finland, Brazil and Portugal.\n[66]\nGillingham and Cambridge United\nInternational career\nBellamy playing for Wales\nin 2011\nRoberts made four more appearances for his country in the qualification stages for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in 2000 and 2001.\n[66] He won a total\nof 15 caps for his country over a 12-year period, including a single appearance and one goal for the Wales B team,[68] but failed to score for the\nsenior team.[66] Roberts is phlegmatic that he made only 17 appearances (\"most as substitute\") for Wales, as he \"had to compete against the likes\nof Mark Hughes, Ian Rush, Dean Saunders, so there were some world-class strikers before me and I was just happy to get in the squad.\"[2] He\nregards the fact that he did not score for Wales as the greatest regret of his career.[69]\nStanding at 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m),[1] Roberts was known for scoring a high proportion of his goals with headers.[70] He had\na strong partnership with Craig Bellamy, beginning when Bellamy broke into the Norwich first team in 1997, aged\n18.[71] They also featured together for Wales, although Roberts never managed to score in 15 appearances for the\nnational side. Roberts said \"I absolutely loved playing up-front with [Bellamy] ... we hit it off straight away, probably\nmore so than anyone else I ever played with. It was like telepathy between us.\"[69] He described the relationship as \"the\nclassic big man, little man\" and noted that in their first season together for Norwich, Roberts scored 24 goals and\nBellamy 17.[69]\nIn 2004, Roberts published an account of his last season at Norwich, entitled All I want for Christmas .... The title of\nthe book was a joke based on Roberts' missing front teeth, a reference to the song \"All I Want for Christmas Is My Two\nFront Teeth\".[5] The book proved controversial, because it included an admission of a deliberate stamp on Wolves\ndefender Kevin Muscat, an incident that had taken place in 2000:\n\"As I got up I 'lost my balance' and trod on his back. Fourteen stone through eight studs, you do the maths.\nHe was in agony, but the ref didn't see it so I got away with it. Of course, I pulled him up and said 'Sorry\nmate, sorry mate', but he knew.\"[72]\nRoberts stated in the book that the stamp was a payback for a serious injury that Muscat had inflicted on Craig Bellamy while Bellamy and Roberts\nwere playing together for Norwich, and that Muscat held no grudges over it.[73]\nBecause of the coverage in the book, the Football Association retrospectively investigated the incident and Roberts, then playing at Gillingham,\nwas banned for three matches and fined Â£2,500 for the offence.[74] Roberts commented that this \"left 'a bitter taste' â�� especially after England\ncaptain David Beckham escaped without a punishment for his deliberate foul in the World Cup qualifier against Wales.\"[75] The Football\nAssociation said there was \"insufficient evidence\" to charge Beckham with bringing the game into disrepute. This was \"despite his admission in\nStyle of play\nAll I Want for Christmas ...\nIwan Roberts appearances, goals and scoring rate\nThe Daily Telegraph and subsequent apology.\"[76] At the time, Roberts told The Daily Telegraph, \"I do not want players to get suspensions and\nfines, but there must be consistency, regardless of who the player is.\"[76] The book was praised by critics. The Daily Telegraph called it \"a rollicking\ngood read. If it doesn't make you at least smile, then it's time to seek counselling.\"[77]\nRoberts has the UEFA A Licence for football coaching and, speaking in 2007, had not ruled out getting into management. He told the Eastern\nDaily Press, \"I've done my qualifications. It's just getting a club to give me a chance and taking it.\"[21] When Norwich sacked Nigel Worthington,\nRoberts applied for the manager's job. \"I tried to go for it ... knowing I wasn't going to get it but I'd never really been for an interview and I thought\nif I did it would stand me in good stead. But I never got a response from the club and that really disappointed me. A week after Peter Grant got the\njob I got a letter through the post saying 'We won't be considering you this time'. And I thought 'I've known that for the past seven days'.\"[21]\nRoberts works in the media. He is bilingual, speaking fluent Welsh, and provides Welsh-language commentary for Sky Sports and BBC Radio\nCymru.\n[78] He also works for BBC Cymru Wales.\n[79] He writes regularly for the local press in Norfolk,[80] commenting on Norwich City and also\ncontributes to the weekly podcast Elis James Feast of Football with comedian Elis James and fellow Welsh former international player Danny\nGabbidon.\n[81]\nRoberts was married in 2016,[82] and has three children; a son and twin\ndaughters.[75]\nIn January 2020, it was reported that Roberts had volunteered for dementia\nresearch.[70]\nIt followed research, published by the University of Glasgow in 2019.[83]\nHe has \"taken a series of simple memory, attention and spatial-awareness tests and\nhe will repeat them every six months\", and will ask former Norwich City colleagues to\ndo the same.[70] As early as in his 2004 autobiography, Roberts had attributed signs\nof memory loss to heading a football: \"I haven't got the best memory ... and I think\nthat comes from heading a football so often, especially in the early days when balls\nwere that bit heavier ... it must have taken its toll.\"[84]\nPost-playing career\nMedia work\nPersonal life\nLegacy\nIn 2002, Roberts was made an inaugural member of the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame.\n[85]\nIn 2007, Roberts came third in a vote run by the\nNorwich Evening News to determine which Norwich legend would be inaugurated into the Professional Footballers' Association Centenary Hall of\nFame.[86]\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition\nClub Season\nLeague FA Cup League Cup Other Total\nDivision Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals\nWatford\n1985â��86\n[87] First Division 4 0 0 0 0 0 â�� 4 0\n1986â��87\n[88] First Division 3 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 4 1\n1987â��88\n[14] First Division 25 2 1 0 4 1 1\n[a] 0 31 3\n1988â��89\n[16] Second Division 22 6 5 0 1 0 4\n[b] 0 32 6\n1989â��90\n[18] Second Division 9 0 1 0 2 2 0 0 12 2\nTotal 63 9 7 0 8 3 5 0 83 12\nHuddersfield Town\n1990â��91\n[26] Third Division 44 13 2 1 2 0 2\n[c] 0 50 14\n1991â��92\n[27] Third Division 46 24 3 3 5 3 7\n[d] 4 61 34\n1992â��93\n[28] Second Division 37 9 5 0 4 2 5\n[c] 4 51 15\n1993â��94\n[29] Second Division 15 4 2 0 3 1 1\n[c] 0 21 5\nTotal 142 50 12 4 14 6 15 8 183 68\nLeicester City\n1993â��94\n[89] First Division 26 13 â�� â�� 1\n[e] 0 27 13\n1994â��95\n[34] Premiership 37 9 3 2 2 0 â�� 42 11\n1995â��96\n[90] First Division 37 19 2 0 3 1 0 0 42 20\nTotal 100 41 5 2 5 1 1 0 111 44\nWolverhampton Wanderers 1996â��97\n[40] First Division 33 12 1 0 2 0 2\n[e] 0 38 12\nNorwich City 1997â��98\n[91] First Division 31 5 0 0 2 2 â�� 33 7\n1998â��99\n[92] First Division 45 19 1 1 5 3 â�� 51 23\n1999â��2000\n[93] First Division 44 17 1 0 4 2 â�� 49 19\nCareer statistics\nClub\n2000â��01\n[94] First Division 44 15 1 1 5 3 â�� 50 19\n2001â��02\n[95] First Division 30 13 0 0 1 0 3\n[e] 1 34 14\n2002â��03\n[55] First Division 43 7 3 0 1 0 â�� 47 7\n2003â��04\n[60] First Division 41 8 1 0 0 0 â�� 42 8\nTotal 278 84 7 2 18 10 3 1 306 97\nGillingham 2004â��05\n[96] Championship 20 3 1 0 1 0 â�� 22 3\nCambridge United (loan) 2004â��05\n[96] League Two 11 3 â�� â�� â�� 11 3\nCareer total 647 202 33 8 48 20 26 9 754 239\na.

in Germanic mythology, attested solely in the Old High German 9th- or 10th-century Second Merseburg Charm. In the verse charm, Sinthgunt is referred to as the sister of the personified sun, Sunna (whose name is alliterative to Sinthgunt),[1] and the two sisters are cited as both producing incantations to heal the horse of Phol, another otherwise unattested figure but possibly the same as Balder, who is named elsewhere in the charm. The two are then followed by Friia and Uolla, also alliterative and stated as sisters.\n\nAs Sinthgunt is otherwise unattested, her significance is otherwise unknown, but some scholarly theories exist about her role in Germanic mythology based on proposed etymologies and the potential significance of her placement within the poem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtymology\n[edit]\n\nThe etymology of Sinthgunt is unclear.  In the original manuscript, Sinthgunt is spelled Sinhtgunt (emphasis added). In the 19th century, Sophus Bugge stuck strictly to this reading, proposing a complex compound based on Germanic *Sin-naχt-gund, i.e., \"the night-walking one\".[2] As a result of the pairing with Sunna, the personified sun (corresponding to Old Norse Sól), this etymology has been interpreted as a reference to the moon. However, this reading has yielded problems; the moon in Germanic mythology is considered masculine, exemplified in the personification of the moon in Norse mythology, Máni, a male figure. According to Rudolf Simek, the historical record lacks evidence for any cult of personified celestial bodies among the ancient Germanic peoples.[3]\n\nStefan Schaffner rejects this etymology, as does Heiner Eichner [de], because the first element Sinht- cannot be based on the presupposed earlier Germanic *sinχt-. Such a Germanic form would have yielded Old High German *sīht by regular sound change.[4] The amended Sinthgunt presupposes a Proto-Germanic compound *Senþa-gunþjō, the first element meaning \"raid, (military) campaign\", the second one \"fight\". This interpretation corresponds well to other Old High German female names such as Sindhilt (from *Senþa-χilðijō, with its second element also meaning \"fight\", cf. Old Norse hildr, Old English hild).[5] Simek also mentions the interpretation \"heavenly body, star\".[6]\n\n\nPlacement\n[edit]\n\nThe figures Fulla (Uolla) and Frigg (Friia) are attested together in later Old Norse sources (though not as sisters), and theories have been proposed that Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. This notion has resulted in a theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of Sinthgunt and Sunna/Sól, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.[7] Similarly, Wolfgang Beck [de] analysed her as a subordinate goddess from Sunna's retinue, a kind of \"situation goddess\", based on her unique appearance in the sources.[8]\n\nFriedrich Kauffmann classified Sinhtgunt as a valkyrie in the 19th century, because the elements -gund and -hild appear frequently in their names.[9] Stefan Schaffner and Heiner Eichner more recently agreed with him, based on Günter Müller's paper on the valkyries' healing powers.[10] \n\nKarl Helm rejected Kauffmann and grouped Sinhtgunt with the Idisi of the First Merseburg Charm, as a specially defined group of Germanic goddesses.[11]\n\n\nNotes\n[edit]\n\n\n\t^ Orchard (1997:112).\n\n\t^ Sophus Bugge.

Kernighan\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMuch of the power of the UNIX operating system comes from a style of program\ndesign that makes programs easy to use and, more important, easy to combine with other\nprograms. This style has been called the use of software tools, and depends more on how\nthe programs fit into the programming environment � how they can be used with other\nprograms � than on how they are designed internally. But as the system has become\ncommercially successful and has spread widely, this style has often been compromised, to\nthe detriment of all users. Old programs have become encrusted with dubious features.\nNewer programs are not always written with attention to proper separation of function\nand design for interconnection. This paper discusses the elements of program design,\nshowing by example good and bad design, and indicates some possible trends for the\nfuture.\n\nThe UNIX operating system has become a great commercial success, and is likely to be the standard\noperating system for microcomputers and some mainframes in the coming years.\n\nThere are good reasons for this popularity. One is portability: the operating system kernel and the\napplications programs are written in the programming language C, and thus can be moved from one type of\ncomputer to another with much less effort than would be involved in recreating them in the assembly lan-\nguage of each machine. Essentially the same operating system therefore runs on a wide variety of comput-\ners, and users needn’t learn a new system when new hardware comes along. Perhaps more important, ven-\ndors that sell the UNIX system needn’t provide new software for each new machine; instead, their software\ncan be compiled and run without change on any hardware, which makes the system commercially attrac-\ntive. There is also an element of zealotry: users of the system tend to be enthusiastic and to expect it wher-\never they go; the students who used the UNIX system in university a few years ago are now in the job mar-\nket and often demand it as a condition of employment.\n\nBut the UNIX system was popular long before it was even portable, let alone a commercial success.\nThe reasons for that are more interesting.\n\nExcept for the initial PDP-7 version, the UNIX system was written for the DEC PDP-11, a machine that\nwas (deservedly) very popular. PDP-11’s were powerful enough to do real computing, but small enough to\nbe affordable by small organizations such as academic departments in universities.\n\nThe early UNIX system was smaller but more effective and technically more interesting than compet-\ning systems on the same hardware. It provided a number of innovative applications of computer science,\nshowing the benefits to be obtained by a judicious blend of theory and practice. Examples include the\nyacc parser-generator, the diff file comparison program, and the pervasive use of regular expressions to\ndescribe string patterns. These led in turn to new programming languages and interesting software for\napplications like program development, document preparation and circuit design.\n\nSince the system was modest in size, and since essentially everything was written in C, the software\nwas easy to modify, to customize for particular applications or merely to support a view of the world\n__________________\n UNIX is a trademark of Bell Laboratories.\n\n\n\n- 2 -\n\ndifferent from the original. (This ease of change is also a weakness, of course, as evidenced by the plethora\nof different versions of the system.)\n\nFinally, the UNIX system provided a new style of computing, a new way of thinking of how to attack\na problem with a computer. This style was based on the use of tools: using programs separately or in com-\nbination to get a job done, rather than doing it by hand, by monolithic self-sufficient subsystems, or by\nspecial-purpose, one-time programs. This has been much discussed in the literature, so we don’t need to\nrepeat it here; see [1], for example.\n\nThe style of use and design of the tools on the system are closely related. The style is still evolving,\nand is the subject of this essay: in particular, how the design and use of a program fit together, how the\ntools fit into the environment, and how the style influences solutions to new problems. The focus of the\ndiscussion is a single example, the program cat, which concatenates a set of files onto its standard output.\ncat is a simple program, both in implementation and in use; it is essential to the UNIX system; and it is a\ngood illustration of the kinds of decisions that delight both supporters and critics of the system. (Often a\nsingle property of the system will be taken as an asset or as a fault by different audiences; our audience is\nprogrammers, because the UNIX environment is designed fundamentally for programming.) Even the\nname cat is typical of UNIX program names: it is short, pronounceable, but not conventional English for\nthe job it does. (For an opposing viewpoint, see [2].) Most important, though, cat in its usages and varia-\ntions exemplifies UNIX program design style and how it has been interpreted by different communities.\n\n11/3/71 CAT (I)\n\nNAME c_a_t_ -- concatenate and print\n\nSYNOPSIS c_a_t_ f_i_l_e_1_ ...\n\nDESCRIPTION c_a_t_ reads each file in sequence and writes it on\nthe standard output stream. Thus:\n\nc_a_t_ f_i_l_e_\n\nis about the easiest way to print a file. Also:\n\nc_a_t_ f_i_l_e_1_ f_i_l_e_2_ >f_i_l_e_3_\n\nis about the easiest way to concatenate files.\n\nIf no input file is given c_a_t_ reads from the\nstandard input file.\n\nFILES --\n\nSEE ALSO pr, cp\n\nDIAGNOSTICS none; if a file cannot be found it is ignored.\n\nBUGS --\n\nOWNER ken, dmr\n\nFigure 1: Manual page for cat, UNIX 1st Edition, November, 1971\n\nFigure 1 is the manual page for cat from the UNIX 1st Edition manual. Evidently, cat copies its input to\nits output. The input is normally taken from a sequence of one or more files, but it can come from the stan-\ndard input. The output is the standard output. The manual suggests two uses, the general file copy:\n\n\n\n- 3 -\n\ncat file1 file2 >file3\n\nand printing a file on the terminal:\n\ncat file\n\nThe general case is certainly what was intended in the design of the program. Output redirection (provided\nby the > operator, implemented by the UNIX shell) makes cat a fine general-purpose file concatenator and\na valuable adjunct for other programs, which can use cat to process filenames, as in:\n\ncat file file2 ... | other-program\n\nThe fact that cat will also print on the terminal is a special case. Perhaps surprisingly, in practice it turns\nout that the special case is the main use of the program. \n\nThe design of cat is typical of most UNIX programs: it implements one simple but general function\nthat can be used in many different applications (including many not envisioned by the original author).\nOther commands are used for other functions. For example, there are separate commands for file system\ntasks like renaming files, deleting them or telling how big they are. Other systems instead lump these into a\nsingle ‘‘file system’’ command with an internal structure and command language of its own. (The PIP file\ncopy program found on operating systems like CP/M or RSX-11 is an example.) That approach is not neces-\nsarily worse or better, but it is certainly against the UNIX philosophy. Unfortunately, such programs are\nnot completely alien to the UNIX system � some mail-reading programs and text editors, for example, are\nlarge self-contained ‘‘subsystems’’ that provide their own complete environments and mesh poorly with the\nrest of the system. Most such subsystems, however, are usually imported from or inspired by programs on\nother operating systems with markedly different programming environments.\n\nThere are some significant advantages to the traditional UNIX system approach. The most important\nis that the surrounding environment � the shell and the programs it can invoke � provides a uniform\naccess to system facilities. Filename argument patterns are expanded by the shell for all programs, without\nprearrangement in each command. The same is true of input and output redirection. Pipes are a natural\noutgrowth of redirection. Rather than decorate each command with options for all relevant pre- and post-\nprocessing, each program expects as input, and produces as output, concise and header-free textual data that\nconnects well with other programs to do the rest of the task at hand. It takes some programming discipline\nto build a program that works well in this environment � primarily, to avoid the temptation to add features\nthat conflict with or duplicate services provided by other commands � but it’s well worthwhile.\n\nGrowth is easy when the functions are well separated. For example, the 7th Edition shell was aug-\nmented with a backquote operator that converts the output of one program into the arguments to another, as\nin\n\ncat ‘cat filelist‘\n\nNo changes were made in any other program when this operator was invented; because the backquote is\ninterpreted by the shell, all programs called by the shell acquire the feature transparently and uniformly. If\nspecial characters like backquotes were instead interpreted, even by calling a standard subroutine, by each\nprogram that found the feature appropriate, every program would require (at least) recompilation whenever\nsomeone had a new idea. Not only would uniformity be hard to enforce, but experimentation would be\nharder because of the effort of installing any changes.\n\nThe UNIX 7th Edition system introduced two changes in cat. First, files that could not be read,\neither because of denied permissions or simple non-existence, were reported rather than ignored. Second,\nand less desirable, was the addition of a single optional argument -u, which forced cat to unbuffer its out-\nput (the reasons for this option, which has disappeared again in the 8th Edition of the system, are technical\nand irrelevant here.)\n\nBut the existence of one argument was enough to suggest more, and other versions of the system\n__________________\n The use of cat to feed a single input file to a program has to some degree superseded the shell’s < operator, which illus-\ntrates that general-purpose constructs � like cat and pipes � are often more natural than convenient special-purpose\nones.\n\n\n\n- 4 -\n\nsoon embellished cat with features. This list comes from cat on the Berkeley distribution of the UNIX\nsystem:\n\n-s strip multiple blank lines to a single instance\n-n number the output lines\n-b number only the non-blank lines\n-v make non-printing characters visible\n\n-ve mark ends of lines\n-vt change representation of tab\n\nIn System V, there are similar options and even a clash of naming: -s instructs cat to be silent\nabout non-existent files. But none of these options are appropriate additions to cat; the reasons get to the\nheart of how UNIX programs are designed and why they work well together.\n\nIt’s easy to dispose of (Berkeley) -s, -n and -b: all of these jobs are readily done with existing tools\nlike sed and awk. For example, to number lines, this awk invocation suffices:\n\nawk ’{ print NR \"\\t\" $0 }’ filenames\n\nIf line-numbering is needed often, this command can be packaged under a name like linenumber and put\nin a convenient public place. Another possibility is to modify the pr command, whose job is to format text\nsuch as program source for output on a line printer. Numbering lines is an appropriate feature in pr; in fact\nUNIX System V pr has a -n option to do so. There never was a need to modify cat; these options are\ngratuitous tinkering.\n\nBut what about -v? That prints non-printing characters in a visible representation. Making strange\ncharacters visible is a genuinely new function, for which no existing program is suitable. (‘‘sed -n l’’,\nthe closest standard possibility, aborts when given very long input lines, which are more likely to occur in\nfiles containing non-printing characters.) So isn’t it appropriate to add the -v option to cat to make\nstrange characters visible when a file is printed?\n\nThe answer is ‘‘No.’’ Such a modification confuses what cat’s job is � concatenating files � with\nwhat it happens to do in a common special case � showing a file on the terminal. A UNIX program\nshould do one thing well, and leave unrelated tasks to other programs. cat’s job is to collect the data in\nfiles. Programs that collect data shouldn’t change the data; cat therefore shouldn’t transform its input.\n\nThe preferred approach in this case is a separate program that deals with non-printable characters.\nWe called ours vis (a suggestive, pronounceable, non-English name) because its job is to make things vis-\nible. As usual, the default is to do what most users will want � make strange characters visible � and as\nnecessary include options for variations on that theme. By making vis a separate program, related useful\nfunctions are easy to provide. For example, the option -s strips out (i.e., discards) strange characters,\nwhich is handy for dealing with files from other operating systems. Other options control the treatment and\nformat of characters like tabs and backspaces that may or may not be considered strange in different situa-\ntions. Such options make sense in vis because its focus is entirely on the treatment of such characters. In\ncat, they require an entire sub-language within the -v option, and thus get even further away from the\nfundamental purpose of that program. Also, providing the function in a separate program makes conve-\nnient options such as -s easier to invent, because it isolates the problem as well as the solution.\n\nOne possible objection to separate programs for each task is efficiency. For example, if we want\nnumbered lines and visible characters it is probably more efficient to run the one command\n\ncat -n -v file\n\nthan the two-element pipeline\n\nlinenumber file | vis\n\nIn practice, however, cat is usually used with no options, so it makes sense to have the common cases be\nthe efficient ones. The current research version of the cat command is actually about five times faster\nthan the Berkeley and System V versions because it can process data in large blocks instead of the byte-at-\ntime processing that might be required if an option is enabled. Also, and this is perhaps more important, it\nis hard to imagine any of these examples being the bottleneck of a production program. Most of the real\n\n\n\n- 5 -\n\ntime is probably taken waiting for the user’s terminal to display the characters, or even for the user to read\nthem.\n\nSeparate programs are not always better than wider options; which is better depends on the problem.\nWhenever one needs a way to perform a new function, one faces the choice of whether to add a new option\nor write a new program (assuming that none of the programmable tools will do the job conveniently). The\nguiding principle for making the choice should be that each program does one thing. Options are appropri-\nately added to a program that already has the right functionality. If there is no such program, then a new\nprogram is called for. In that case, the usual criteria for program design should be used: the program should\nbe as general as possible, its default behavior should match the most common usage, and it should cooper-\nate with other programs.\n\nLet’s look at these issues in the context of another problem, dealing with fast terminal lines. The first\nversions of the UNIX system were written in the days when 150 baud was ‘‘fast,’’ and all terminals used\npaper. Today, 9600 baud is typical, and hard-copy terminals are rare. How should we deal with the fact\nthat output from programs like cat scrolls off the top of the screen faster than one can read it?\n\nThere are two obvious approaches. One is to tell each program about the properties of terminals, so it\ndoes the right thing (whether by option or automatically). The other is to write a command that handles ter-\nminals, and leave most programs untouched.\n\nAn example of the first approach is Berkeley’s version of the ls command, which lists the filenames\nin a directory. Let us call it lsc to avoid confusion. The 7th Edition ls command lists filenames in a sin-\ngle column, so for a large directory, the list of filenames disappears off the top of the screen at great speed.\nlsc prints in columns across the screen (which is assumed to be 80 columns wide), so there are typically\nfour to eight times as many names on each line, and thus the output usually fits on one screen. The option\n-1 can be used to get the old single-column behavior.\n\nSurprisingly, lsc operates differently if its output is a file or pipe:\n\nlsc\n\nproduces output different from\n\nlsc | cat\n\nThe reason is that lsc begins by examining whether or not its output is a terminal, and prints in columns\nonly if it is. By retaining single-column output to files or pipes, lsc ensures compatibility with programs\nlike grep or wc that expect things to be printed one per line. This ad hoc adjustment of the output format\ndepending on the destination is not only distasteful, it is unique � no standard UNIX command has this\nproperty.\n\nA more insidious problem with lsc is that the columnation facility, which is actually a useful, gen-\neral function, is built in and thus inaccessible to other programs that could use a similar compression. Pro-\ngrams should not attempt special solutions to general problems. The automatic columnation in lsc is rem-\niniscent of the ‘‘wild cards’’ found in some systems that provide filename pattern matching only for a par-\nticular program. The experience with centralized processing of wild cards in the UNIX shell shows over-\nwhelmingly how important it is to centralize the function where it can be used by all programs.\n\nOne solution for the ls problem is obvious � a separate program for columnation, so that columna-\ntion into say 5 columns is just\n\nls | 5\n\nIt is easy to build a first-draft version with the multi-column option of pr. The commands 2, 3, etc., are all\nlinks to a single file:\n\npr -$0 -t -l1 $*\n\n$0 is the program name (2, 3, etc.), so -$0 becomes -n where n is the number of columns that pr is to\nproduce. The other options suppress the normal heading, set the page length to 1 line, and pass the argu-\nments on to pr. This implementation is typical of the use of tools � it takes only a moment to write, and it\nserves perfectly well for most applications. If a more general service is desired, such as automatically\nselecting the number of columns for optimal compaction, a C program is probably required, but the one-\n\n\n\n- 6 -\n\nline implementation above satisfies the immediate need and provides a base for experimentation with the\ndesign of a fancier program, should one become necessary.\n\nSimilar reasoning suggests a solution for the general problem of data flowing off screens (colum-\nnated or not): a separate program to take any input and print it a screen at a time. Such programs are by\nnow widely available, under names like pg and more. This solution affects no other programs, but can be\nused with all of them. As usual, once the basic feature is right, the program can be enhanced with options\nfor specifying screen size, backing up, searching for patterns, and anything else that proves useful within\nthat basic job.\n\nThere is still a problem, of course. If the user forgets to pipe output into pg, the output that goes off\nthe top of the screen is gone. It would be desirable if the facilities of pg were always present without hav-\ning to be requested explicitly.\n\nThere are related useful functions that are typically only available as part of a particular program, not\nin a central service. One example is the history mechanism provided by some versions of the UNIX shell:\ncommands are remembered, so it’s possible to review and repeat them, perhaps with editing. But why\nshould this facility be restricted to the shell? (It’s not even general enough to pass input to programs called\nby the shell; it applies to shell commands only.) Certainly other programs could profit as well; any interac-\ntive program could benefit from the ability to re-execute commands. More subtly, why should the facility\nbe restricted to program input? Pipes have shown that the output from one program is often useful as input\nto another. With a little editing, the output of commands such as ls or make can be turned into commands\nor data for other programs.\n\nAnother facility that could be usefully centralized is typified by the editor escape in some mail com-\nmands. It is possible to pick up part of a mail message, edit it, and then include it in a reply. But this is all\ndone by special facilities within the mail command and so its use is restricted.\n\nEach such service is provided by a different program, which usually has its own syntax and seman-\ntics. This is in contrast to features such as pagination, which is always the same because it is only done by\none program. The editing of input and output text is more environmental than functional; it is more like the\nshell’s expansion of filename metacharacters than automatic numbering of lines of text. But since the shell\ndoes not see the characters sent as input to the programs, it cannot provide such editing. The emacs edi-\ntor3 provides a limited form of this capability, by processing all UNIX command input and output, but this\nis expensive, clumsy, and subjects the users to the complexities and vagaries of yet another massive subsys-\ntem (which isn’t to criticize the inventiveness of the idea).\n\nA potentially simpler solution is to let the terminal or terminal interface do the work, with controlled\nscrolling, editing and retransmission of visible text, and review of what has gone before. We have used the\nprogrammability of the Blit terminal4 � a programmable bitmap graphics display � to capitalize on this\npossibility, to good effect.\n\nThe Blit uses a mouse to point to characters on the display, which can be edited, rearranged and\ntransmitted back to the UNIX system as though they had been typed on the keyboard. Because the terminal\nis essentially simulating typed input, the programs are oblivious to how the text was created; all the features\ndiscussed above are provided by the general editing capabilities of the terminal, with no changes to the\nUNIX programs.\n\nThere are some obvious direct advantages to the Blit’s ability to process text under the user’s control.\nShell history is trivial: commands can be selected with the mouse, edited if desired, and retransmitted.\nSince from the terminal’s viewpoint all text on the display is equivalent, history is limited neither to the\nshell nor to command input. Because the Blit provides editing, most of the interactive features of programs\nlike mail are unnecessary; they are done easily, transparently and uniformly by the terminal.\n\nThe most interesting facet of this work, however, is the way it removes the need for interactive fea-\ntures in programs; instead, the Blit is the place where interaction is provided, much as the shell is the pro-\ngram that interprets filename-matching metacharacters. Unfortunately, of course, programming the termi-\nnal demands access to a part of the environment off-limits to most programmers, but the solution meshes\nwell with the environment and is appealing in its simplicity. If the terminal cannot be modified to provide\nthe capabilities, a user-level program or perhaps the UNIX kernel itself could be modified fairly easily to do\nroughly what the Blit does, with similar results.\n\n\n\n- 7 -\n\nThe key to problem-solving on the UNIX system is to identify the right primitive operations and to\nput them at the right place. UNIX programs tend to solve general problems rather than special cases. In a\nvery loose sense, the programs are orthogonal, spanning the space of jobs to be done (although with a fair\namount of overlap for reasons of history, convenience or efficiency). Functions are placed where they will\ndo the most good: there shouldn’t be a pager in every program that produces output any more than there\nshould be filename pattern matching in every program that uses filenames.\n\nOne thing that UNIX does not need is more features. It is successful in part because it has a small\nnumber of good ideas that work well together. Merely adding features does not make it easier for users to\ndo things � it just makes the manual thicker. The right solution in the right place is always more effective\nthan haphazard hacking.\n\n1. B. W. Kernighan and Rob Pike, The UNIX Programming Environment, Prentice-Hall (1984).\n\n2. D.

The\ninvention of new facilities in computing systems can be guided by these principles. For\nexample, the introduction of networking need not require any change to the majority of\nsystem utilities, because objects such as files on remote machines can be given syntacti-\ncally familiar names within the local machine’s name space. Indeed, the implementers of\nnetworks often do well by these standards by striving to make remote files essentially\nindistinguishable from local ones. Unfortunately, the situation with internetwork mail\naddresses is not as satisfactory. The practitioners of internetworking would profit by\nunderstanding the benefits of simple, uniform syntax.\n\nresearch!ucbvax!@cmu-cs-pt.arpa:@CMU-ITC-LINUS:dave%CMU-ITC-LINUS@CMU-CS-PT\n\n- Carnegie-Mellon University mailer\n\nI cannot tell what the dickens his name is.\n- Shakespeare, Merry Wives of Windsor, II. ii. 20.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAny object relevant to computation — file, process, user, computer, network or whatever — needs a\nname. The name determines the access: it is by interpreting the name, within the name space it inhabits,\nthat a program or person is given access to the object. The manner in which names are constructed affects\nnot only how objects are named but also how they are used.\n\nThe form of names and name spaces is the subject of this essay. We will use file names from several\noperating systems as examples to illustrate criteria for distinguishing good names from bad. The same cri-\nteria may be applied to network mail names, pointing out some of the shortcomings of the current ad hoc\nsystems for internetworking.\n\nThe criteria are not new, and seem to be generally accepted, but are not applied in practice. This\npaper is an attempt to re-establish their use.\n\nPrinciples of Names and Name Spaces\n\nWhat’s in a name? A string of characters, encoded by some convention (ASCII or EBCDIC), that\nidentifies an object. If the function of a name stopped there, this definition would be sufficient. In IBM’s\nMVS, for example, a file name is an at most 44-character string, largely uninterpreted by system software.\nThe name space is ‘flat,‘ or linear.\n\nSystems designed more recently use names to help organize as well as identify. For instance,\nalthough in MVS the disk containing the file is specified separately from the name, in MS-DOS part of the\n__________________\n† An earlier version of this appeared in Summer 1985 Usenix Conference Proceedings, Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\n\n\n- 2 -\n\nname of a file is a string that identifies the disk drive holding the file. Syntax separates these components\nof the name; MS-DOS uses a colon following the disk name, a single character:\n\nA:FILE\n\nis a file on disk drive A, while\n\nB:FILE\n\nis a file on disk drive B.\n\nThe advantage of putting such information in names is that software need not know about disks to\nmanipulate files. Internally, of course, system software must use the syntax of the name to locate the file,\nbut this is largely transparent to applications software, and users.\n\nThe MVS system uses independent information (stored in a catalog) to find a file given its name,\nwhile MS-DOS exposes location information in the name. MS-DOS users may put related files on the\nsame disk, thus using a distinguished piece of the name to help organize their world. MVS users must\ninstead adapt ad hoc strategies (conventions for the syntax of names) to the same end. Thus each system\ndoes both more and less for the user: MVS provides no help in organization and a naming independent of\nthe physical location of the file, while MS-DOS provides the opposite. Instead, if names had multiple\ncomponents (that is, syntax), where the components did not necessarily correspond to physical devices, the\nname space would have the advantages of that of both MVS and MS-DOS, with the disadvantages of\nneither. Such a name space exists.\n\nA good example: UNIX®\n\nUNIX file name space is a tree, with file names that specify a path from one node to another. The\nrepresentation of the name is a simple ASCII string, with slashes / separating node identifiers. The name\n\n/usr/rob/bin/cat-v\n\nis a path from the root of the tree (denoted by the leading slash), through nodes called usr, rob and bin,\nto a file called cat-v. Nodes intermediate in the tree are called directories. The system uses the compo-\nnents to find the file, which the user can use as syntax to organize sets of files. For example, although on\nmost UNIX systems, the string /usr specifies a separate disk drive, this is irrelevant to both software and\nusers; it is merely a string that identifies the directory beneath which users’ files may be found.\n\nThe structure of the name space (a directory tree) is reflected in the style of the name (a path through\nthe tree). Were the file system arranged differently, say as a flat array, the form and interpretation of file\nnames would also be different; for example, UNIX processes are named by small integers.\n\nProperties of Name Spaces\n\nName spaces have some general properties. First, names within the space may be absolute or rela-\ntive. Absolute names specify an object by position with respect to a single fixed point, such as the root of\nthe UNIX file system (named /); relative names, with respect to a local point (the ‘current working direc-\ntory’ in UNIX, named . (dot)). Also, an operating system typically has operators to manipulate its name\nspace, such as system calls to create and remove files. UNIX also provides a system call (named mount) to\njoin together two name spaces by attaching the root of one space, resident on a separate disk drive, to a leaf\nof another.\n\nFinally, a name space has syntax — how a name is constructed — and semantics — the nature of the\nobject a name identifies.\n\nA UNIX file name, for example, is a sequence of slash-separated strings that identifies a formatless\nbyte stream. External conventions may provide further semantics: the UNIX file system contains objects\nthat are not ordinary files. Simply by having ordinary file names, though, these objects have ordinary file\nproperties such as protection. Some examples from our research version of UNIX, called the Ninth Edition:\n\nDevice files. With names conventionally prefixed (that is, residing in the directory) /dev, these files pro-\nvide direct access to devices. The name /dev/mt, for example, identifies a magnetic tape drive.\n\nProcesses. The directory /proc contains files with names that are process numbers. Opening such a file\n\n\n\n- 3 -\n\nprovides access to processes for purposes such as interactive debugging. Although processes have\nintegers that identify them, it is convenient to provide names for them in the file system as well. For\nexample, listing the directory containing the process files is a simple way to identify running pro-\ncesses.\n\nDatabases. Some databases are conveniently represented as name-value pairs in a hierarchy, and such data-\nbases may be mapped into the file system name space. For example, the directory /n/face con-\ntains a hierarchically-structured database that associates digitized images of people’s faces with the\npeople’s electronic mail addresses.\n\nOther files. UNIX has the notion of standard input: the input connected to a (typically) interactive program.\nThe name /dev/stdin identifies a file that, when opened, connects to the standard input of the\nprogram. This allows files that demand a file name (such as the file comparison program) to be given\ninput directly from the interactive terminal or from a pipe.\n\nBecause these unusual objects have regular names, existing tools can treat them as files, so standard soft-\nware can provide services for them that would otherwise require special handling.\n\nSome of the Ninth Edition examples above have different names in other UNIX systems.\n/dev/stdin is often represented by the single character -, as an argument to commands, but this con-\nvention is capriciously followed. Because it must be provided explicitly by each program, it is only avail-\nable in some programs. By providing /dev/stdin in the global name space, it is available uniformly for\nall programs, always. As another example, processes are represented by an integer process identifier, which\nis only meaningful to a few process-specific system calls. These calls implement their own protection\nmechanism, although the protection provided by the file system suits perfectly (these system calls predate\nthe process file system). Finally, virtual terminals implemented using the multiplexed files of the Seventh\nEdition (an earlier research version of the system) have no external name, so it is impossible to open one for\nI/O. The Ninth Edition provides a name in the file system that is available, without prearrangement or spe-\ncial protocol, to any program.\n\nConnecting Name Spaces\n\nWhen machines are connected together, their name spaces may be joined to facilitate the sharing of\nfiles. If the name spaces have the same clean structure, that structure can be extended simply to describe\nthe larger space. The Newcastle Connection names a file on another machine, say ucbvax, as\n/../ucbvax/usr/rob/bin/cat-v; the Ninth Edition notation is\n/n/ucbvax/usr/rob/bin/cat-v. In the former the name space has been extended by making it a\nsubspace of a larger space, in the latter a new name subspace has been grafted on using mount, but in nei-\nther case has the syntax of names been changed; any program that understands a file name will understand a\nnetwork file name without change, and relative names for files (those that don’t begin with /) are\nunchanged. As a spectacular example, we might see on which machines user wnj has a login by searching\n(using a program called grep) through the system administration files (called /etc/passwd) on all the\nmachines:\n\ngrep wnj /n/*/etc/passwd\n\nThe file name ‘wild card’ character * matches all files within a directory. Here, it happens to match all\nmachines reachable from the local machine, although grep is oblivious of this distinction. We could even\ninvestigate those machines connected to ucbvax by\n\ngrep wnj /n/ucbvax/n/*/etc/passwd\n\nThe file system that is the union of these name spaces might have no global root, so the meaning of\nan absolute name may become ambiguous because of the presence of multiple reference points. In fact,\nthere might be no single point to which all names can be fixed. In practice, though, this ambiguity is unim-\nportant.\n\n\n\n- 4 -\n\nA bad example: VAX/VMS\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone chooses naming conventions in accord with these guidelines. On\nVAX/VMS our canonical file might be called UCBVAX::SYS$DISK:[ROB.BIN]CAT_V.EXE;13.\nThe VMS file naming scheme provides a distinct syntax for each level in the name: UCBVAX:: is a\nmachine; SYS$DISK: is a disk (actually a macro that expands to a disk name such as DUA0:);\n[ROB.BIN] is a directory; CAT_V is a file ‘base’ name; .EXE is a file ‘type’; and ;13 is a version num-\nber.\n\nAlthough this syntax may seem unnecessarily cumbersome, it has a precedent: it is analogous to\nexpressions in programming languages. Consider a C expression such as\n*structure[index].field->ptr. If * were postfix and / the only dereferencing operator, the\nexpression might be written structure/index/field/ptr/. Functionally-minded programmers\nmight use the notation contents(ptr(field(index(structure)))). (A single character can-\nnot be used in C because it could not distinguish X[Y] and X->Y, with X a structure pointer and Y an inte-\nger or structure element respectively, but this ambiguity could be eliminated in a different language.) C and\nVMS use syntax to distinguish the types of the components of a name. Instead, the UNIX file system delib-\nerately hides the distinctions. Aside from the obvious advantages such as simplicity of syntax and the\nusurping of only a single character, the uniformity also makes the name space easier to manipulate: the\nmount system call aliases a disk and a directory.\n\nVMS has no true name space manipulation operator. Although one could be constructed, it would be\nlimited in scope: how could a disk be mounted atop SYS$DISK:[ROB.BIN] when disks are always\nbefore directories in the name? Instead, VMS has macros such as SYS$DISK to hide the manner in which\nthe space is assembled, and even to provide the concept of a local name by automatically inserting an\nexpanded macro before an unqualified name.\n\nThe problems with dynamic evaluation of macros are well known. For example, the VMS service to\nset the reference point for local names (the equivalent of UNIX chdir) sets the default prefix for file\nnames, but the prefix will only be evaluated and so checked for validity, when a file name is interpreted,\nwhich may be arbitrarily and confusingly long after the prefix was set. In fact, the default prefix macro is\nhandled in a special way, because directories are not constructed by simple concatenation; subdirectory\n[.BIN] in directory [ROB] is named [ROB.BIN]. Also, these local names are not really local at all; the\nprefix implicitly binds them to a root of the name space. This implies that all names are always attached to\nsome root, and therefore if the root changes, the name must also change, invisibly.\n\nAnother problem with VMS names is that one cannot do the equivalent of searching the VMS pass-\nword files (SYSUAF.LIS) on various machines with *::SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAF.LIS; the * operator\ndoesn’t apply to that portion of a name. This is an example of the general problem that whenever the name\nsyntax is changed all programs that interpret names must be modified. More subtly, although if the\nmachine ucbvax were a gateway we could access files on a distant machine as\nUCBVAX::KREMVAX::file, it is only because the semantics of :: explicitly permit such access. The\n:: operator is implemented by passing the string after it to the remote machine, but first checking its syn-\ntax, so the file name parser must have special code for multiple ::’s.\n\nA Quibble about Cedar\n\nThe Cedar file system has a uniform naming syntax, just like UNIX, except that files have version\nnumbers, separated from the file name by an exclamation mark !. The implementers thought that version\nnumbers are fundamentally different components of file names and therefore deserved different syntax. But\nthe change in syntax requires new rules to define the meaning of file names. A good test of naming\nschemes is whether arbitrary names constructed by the syntactic rules make sense within the rules of the\nsystem or whether their interpretation requires new semantic rules. In Cedar file,\n/usr/rob/bin/cat-v!3 is clearly version 3 of cat-v, but what is /usr/rob!3/bin/cat-v?\n\n\n\n- 5 -\n\nConnecting to other machine’s file systems\n\nThe IBIS remote file system on UNIX 4.2BSD names a remote file as ucbvax:file. Many pro-\ngrams don’t understand this syntax; the shell (command interpreter) must be modified to make *:file\nbehave as we expect, because the shell expects a slash to separate name components. Worse, by changing\nthe syntax, the implicit semantics of the original naming scheme is lost. In the Ninth Edition name\n/n/ucbvax/file it is obvious what file refers to: a file in the root directory of ucbvax. But what\nis it in ucbvax:file? It might be a file in the root, but it isn’t. It is a file in the initial working directory\non the destination machine (ucbvax) of the user invoking the name on the source machine (unless it\nbegins with /); its meaning depends on who is asking. The extra semantics of : complicate attempts to\npatch the syntactic problems. We might try creating a connection (called a symbolic link in UNIX) from the\nname /n/ucbvax to the name ucbvax:, but /n/ucbvax/file would then still point to a file in\nsomeone’s home directory, and /n/ucbvax/usr/wnj/file would refer to\n/usr/wnj/usr/wnj/file. If the link evaluates to ucbvax:/, things work as expected, but the\nslash-less form of IBIS naming is made unavailable.\n\nPart of the problem in the IBIS file system is that it is implemented outside the name space. By using\na variant of the standard system call mount, the Ninth Edition remote file system guarantees that the syn-\ntax and semantics of names are free of surprises. For example, it is clear what\n/n/ucbvax/n/kremvax/file refers to, but what about the IBIS name ucbvax:kremvax:file?\nWhere does kremvax:file get interpreted?\n\nThere are other ways to interpret file names like ucbvax:file. When using the UNIX program\nuucp to copy a local file to a remote machine, the name ucbvax!file refers to the file on ucbvax\nwhose name is file prefixed by the current directory on the source machine. The prize goes to DECNET,\nhowever: ucbvax::file refers to file in the home directory of the ‘default network user’ on the desti-\nnation machine, and ucbvax\"wnj password\"::file refers to file in wnj’s home directory. It is\ninexcusable that the password is in the file name, let alone that it is in clear text.\n\nThe story so far\n\nIn summary, there are some guidelines for constructing naming conventions, particularly for objects\nin a network. There should be both relative names and absolute names. Relative names are more important\nbecause, among other reasons, the root of the name space may be unknown or non-unique. The syntax\nshould be clean and uniform; every new syntactic rule requires at least one, and usually many, semantic\nrules to resolve peculiarities introduced by the new syntax. If the name space is a tree or any other kind of\ngraph, a single character should be used to separate nodes in a name.\n\nIf these guidelines are followed, names of objects in a network of machines will be easy to construct\nand interpret; difficult problems of networking will be completely hidden to the users and programs access-\ning objects in the network. If they are ignored, both users and programs must be aware of and understand\nthe details of naming locally, globally and everywhere in between.\n\nPrinciples of mail names\n\nNow consider the other common name space, mail names. Mail names are more complex than file\nnames, for both syntactic and semantic reasons. There are conflicting syntactic traditions, the most familiar\ntwo being the UNIX tradition and the ARPANET tradition. Also, mail names are interpreted by user pro-\ngrams only, with no operating system to enforce semantics. Thus, the interpretation of the name space is\nsubject to arbitrary hackery.\n\nEven a trivial case like the name pjw in the command\n\nmail pjw\n\nhas no clear meaning. When electronic mail was invented, the name pjw referred to a mailbox on the local\nmachine — the only machine to which mail could be sent. The local space of mailbox names was a small\nflat space. Later, when systems were connected together, there were two ways to generalize. If the com-\nputers were closely connected (that is, sharing administration), one could extend the flat name space over\nthe whole set of machines, so that saying mail pjw on any of the machines gets pjw’s mailbox on pjw’s\n\n\n\n- 6 -\n\nhome machine. If the machines were instead loosely connected, a more attractive scheme would be to use\nmachine names to qualify the local mailbox names: pjw@system in the ARPANET tradition, or\nsystem!pjw in the UNIX tradition. The two methods differ only in the naming and how the software\ndecides to find the destination. In the first alternative, it looks up pjw in a database, while in the second it\nlooks up system. In both cases, the software on the machines involved must also have a protocol for\ndelivering mail, but that’s irrelevant here. Note that neither naming scheme has anything to do with routing\nthe message.\n\nAt this level, either of these two schemes is fairly convenient. But when we try to connect lots of\nsystems with these flat name spaces, names must either conflict or be decorated artificially to disambiguate\nthem. We should apply the principles of good naming to find a better solution.\n\nMail names specify paths within a large name space populated by systems and mailboxes rather than\nfiles, but the basic idea is the same. The question is what a path denotes. The answer depends on how the\nsoftware determines what to do with the mail.\n\nImagine we are on machine ucbvax and want to send mail to pjw@system. There are two meth-\nods to negotiate the transaction. The first method, used by UNIX, views system as the name of an author-\nity that the mail and mail address are passed to. That is, sending the mail involves a message to system of\nthe form, ‘‘I am machine ucbvax, here is mail for pjw.’’ The second, that of the ARPANET, interprets\nsystem as the name of an authority that will say where to send the mail, as in, ‘‘I am machine ucbvax,\nwhere do I send mail for pjw?’’ The destination of these messages is found by looking up system in a\ndatabase. (The details of sending the message are outside this discussion.) All naming schemes for mail\nfollow some combination of these alternatives. The UNIX method uses the same mechanism to resolve\nnames and to transmit mail; the ARPANET method resolves the names with one mechanism and uses some\nother, not associated with the name at all, to send the mail.\n\nGiven these two models, how do we generalize mail delivery in larger networks? For ARPANET, a\nmail address user@world3.world2.world1 is interpreted by looking up world1 and then asking it\nwhere to send mail for world3.world2. For UNIX, a mail address world1!world2!world3!user\nis interpreted by looking up world1 and then sending the mail and world2!world3!user to it.\nAlthough the two forms sound similar, they have different problems. (And, why does ARPA use two char-\nacters when one is sufficient?)\n\nThe most common interpretation of the UNIX name is as a route, but it need have nothing to do with\na route. Once the name is handed off to world1, it can be rewritten to correspond to the syntax of\nworld1’s name space; in fact, UNIX mailers rewrite names freely. Because ARPANET names are han-\ndled differently, they cannot be rewritten: the answer to the routing question must produce the four-byte\nbinary network address of the destination mailbox. (At least in principle, this defect may be circumvented.\nThe response to the routing question might be a little program: ‘‘Send the mail to A and tell it to use proto-\ncol P to send it to B’’ and so forth. However, that’s not how it’s done in practice.)\n\nConsider again the relation between mail names and file names. When the operating system inter-\nprets the name /n/ucbvax/n/kremvax/file it discovers that the directory /n/ucbvax refers to a\nremote machine, finds the server on that machine, and sends it the name /n/kremvax/file expecting\nback a handle to use the file. It does not care what the server does with the name. It does not expect to get\nback instructions for finding the file. It is asking for file service, not name service. Indeed were ucbvax a\nVMS machine, the server might invisibly translate /n/kremvax/file immediately into\nKREMVAX::SYS$DISK:[NETUSER]file to discover it on its local system. Remote file access would\nbe harder to implement using the ARPANET scheme.\n\nName servers† considered speculative\n\nName servers don’t scale well, for precisely the reason that the ARPANET name scheme doesn’t scale\nwell: the name server must understand all possible name syntaxes. When a system with a different naming\nconvention is connected, the name server must suddenly interpret all the different syntaxes, instead of\n__________________\n† ‘‘Name server’’ is a noun phrase that is ambiguous. You hand a name server a name, it hands you connection informa-\ntion. Thus it serves connections, not names. Consider the difference between air pollution and noise pollution.\n\n\n\n- 7 -\n\nleaving the job to the new system itself. Worse, how do you connect two networks, each with its own name\nserver? Even if the servers use the same data formats and algorithms, they might use unique identifiers that\nbecome non-unique when they are joined.\n\nName servers have problems on other levels, too. Who administers a name server’s database? If the\ndatabase is not audited frequently much of the data will be obsolete, while if the controls are too onerous,\npeople won’t bother keeping the database current. What does the database contain? Most name servers\nproduce network addresses, but no single network reaches everywhere.\n\nWhy are mail names such a mess?\n\nBecause people keep gluing name spaces together without smoothing the syntactic differences. The\nresult is the mail name equivalent of bastardized file names like\n/n/ucbvax/UCBVAX::KREMVAX:/rob/bin/A:dos-file where different conventions are mixed\nin a single string.\n\nRelative names are important\n\nThe ARPANET people define their names to have the form\n\nlocal-part@domain\n\nwhere both local-part and domain are dot-separated lists of words. Domains are the generalization of what\nwe have been calling systems; the local part is anything understood by the leftmost domain name. Accord-\ning to RFC 882 (‘‘Domain Names – Concepts and Facilities’’), the domains are all absolute. The dot signi-\nfying the root of the hierarchy is implicit at the right of the list of names, which makes it impossible to con-\nnect disjoint name spaces since all interpreters of names must know all names at the top level of the hierar-\nchy. Also, for backwards compatibility, RFC 822 (‘‘Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Mes-\nsages’’) allows all but the leftmost of the domain names to be elided, since ‘‘specification of a fully quali-\nfied address can become inconvenient.’’\n\nWhat happens in practice?\n\nAs long as software continues to deliver mail, people are unwilling to improve the state of affairs.\nMailers just butt together names with their own rewriting rules, producing names like:\n\nIJQ3SRA%UCLAMVS.BITNET%SU-LINDY@SU-CSLI.ARPA\n\nThis is the name of user IJQ3SRA on machine UCLAMVS, accessible through BITNET from machine\nSU-LINDY, which is known to SU-CSLI on the ARPANET. Each program that touched this name\nrewrote it by its own rules, although the domains proposal is intended to prevent this.\n\nThere are two domains in this name (although the syntax is wrong): BITNET and ARPA. However,\nBITNET is not a registered name, so the gateway service between BITNET and ARPANET must be made\nexplicit in the name, requiring the invention of a new syntax character (%) which is translated to @ at the\ngateway, because ARPANET names can only contain a single @. Despite the words in the standard about\nhierarchy, the domain space is nearly flat, so the local parts of the names carry source routing and domain\ntransitions explicitly. To worsen matters, machines that advertise adherence to the standard in fact do not;\ninstead the name translations that occur at gateways (such as converting @ to % and rearranging the compo-\nnents) are at best ad hoc. By legislating away bad names, ARPANET has reduced the problem of\nnetworking to a still-unsolved problem. But the mailers plod resolutely on.\n\nStandards?\n\nIt is clear that standards are necessary for electronic mail to be delivered reliably across network\nboundaries. What needs to be standardized is the interpretation of names, especially at network boundaries.\nUntil such a standard exists; is syntactically and semantically clean; distributes the interpretation of names\nacross the systems that understand them; and is adhered to, the network mail situation will not improve.\n\n\n\n- 8 -\n\nConclusions\n\nDoug McIlroy has observed that\n\n... bad notations can stifle progress. Roman numerals hobbled mathematics for a millennium but\nwere propagated by custom and by natural deference to authority. Today we no longer meekly accept\nindividual authority. Instead, we have ‘‘standards,’’ impersonal imprimaturs on convention. Some\nstandards are sound and indispensable; some simply celebrate bureaucratic littleness of mind. A har-\nvest of gimmicks to save appearances within the standard has grown up, then gimmicks to save the\nappearances within the appearances. You know how each one got there: an overnight hack to paste\nanother tumor onto a wild cancerous growth. The concern was with method, regardless of results.\nThe result is extravagantly worse than Roman numerals: you can’t read the notation right to left or\nleft to right. As an amalgam of languages, it can’t be deciphered by a native speaker of any one of\nthem, much as if we were to switch at random places in a number between Roman and Arabic signs\nand between big-endian and little-endian order. But now that it all ‘‘works’’ — at least for the strong\nof stomach — the tumors themselves are being standardized.\n\nI fled, and cry’d out ‘‘Death’’;\nHell trembled at the hideous name, and sigh’d\nFrom all her caves, and back resounded, ‘‘Death.’’\n\n- Milton, Paradise Lost\n\n\n","extracted_metadata":{"pdf:containsDamagedFont":["false"],"pdf:encrypted":["false"],"xmp:ModifyDate":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"dc:title":["Untitled"],"xmp:CreateDate":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"pdf:overallPercentageUnmappedUnicodeChars":["0.0"],"dcterms:modified":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"access_permission:assemble_document":["true"],"pdf:hasXMP":["true"],"X-TIKA:Parsed-By":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.pdf.PDFParser"],"pdf:docinfo:producer":["GPL Ghostscript SVN PRE-RELEASE 8.61"],"access_permission:modify_annotations":["true"],"pdf:hasXFA":["false"],"dc:format":["application/pdf; version=1.4"],"xmpTPg:NPages":["8"],"pdf:hasCollection":["false"],"X-TIKA:Parsed-By-Full-Set":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.pdf.PDFParser"],"pdf:charsPerPage":["2579","3892","3845","4104","4169","4568","3613","1318"],"pdf:totalUnmappedUnicodeChars":["0"],"Content-Length":["32949"],"Content-Type":["application/pdf"],"pdf:docinfo:modified":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"pdf:hasMarkedContent":["false"],"pdf:producer":["GPL Ghostscript SVN PRE-RELEASE 8.61"],"xmp:About":["b5b6260c-1643-11e8-0000-0e1a6b6e9242"],"access_permission:can_print_degraded":["true"],"access_permission:extract_for_accessibility":["true"],"pdf:num3DAnnotations":["0"],"pdf:unmappedUnicodeCharsPerPage":["0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"],"xmpMM:DocumentID":["b5b6260c-1643-11e8-0000-0e1a6b6e9242"],"access_permission:can_print":["true"],"xmp:CreatorTool":["UnknownApplication"],"resourceName":["The Hideous Name - 1985 (pike85hideous).pdf"],"access_permission:extract_content":["true"],"access_permission:can_modify":["true"],"dcterms:created":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"pdf:PDFVersion":["1.4"],"access_permission:fill_in_form":["true"],"pdf:docinfo:created":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"pdf:containsNonEmbeddedFont":["true"]},"metadata_field_count":40,"attempts":1,"timestamp":1752386767.696541,"platform":"Linux","python_version":"3.13.5"},{"file_path":"test_documents/pdfs/fake-memo.pdf","file_size":13374,"file_type":"pdf","category":"tiny","framework":"extractous","iteration":0,"extraction_time":0.05060219764709473,"startup_time":null,"peak_memory_mb":444.23828125,"avg_memory_mb":444.01328125,"peak_cpu_percent":58.4,"avg_cpu_percent":11.68,"total_io_mb":null,"status":"success","character_count":215,"word_count":37,"error_type":null,"error_message":null,"quality_metrics":{"char_count":215,"word_count":37,"sentence_count":3,"paragraph_count":5,"avg_word_length":4.45945945945946,"avg_sentence_length":12.333333333333334,"extraction_completeness":1.0,"text_coherence":1.0,"noise_ratio":0.0,"gibberish_ratio":0.07407407407407407,"flesch_reading_ease":77.70585585585587,"gunning_fog_index":6.014414414414415,"has_proper_formatting":true,"maintains_line_breaks":true,"preserves_whitespace":false,"table_structure_preserved":false,"format_specific_score":1.0,"expected_content_preserved":false,"has_encoding_issues":false,"has_ocr_artifacts":false,"preserves_pdf_formatting":true},"overall_quality_score":0.72213231981982,"extracted_text":"\nMay 5, 2023\n\n\nTo Whom it May Concern:\n\n\nThere were 20,000 bottles of water, 10,000 blankets, and 200 laptops delivered on January 23, \n2023.

slot\n\npolyhymnia p-->0             10         1 reject\n\np-->1             11         2 reject\n\np-->2             12         3\n\nurania u-->0              6         6 reject\n\nu-->1              7         7 reject\n\nu-->2              8         8 reject\n\nu-->3              9         0 reject\n\nu-->4             10         1 ok\n\nSo, if we define g() as determined above, then h() will be a minimal perfect hash \nfunction on the given set of words.\n\nThe primary difficulty is the cost, because the search phase can degenerate to \nexponential performance, and so it is only practical for small sets of words.\n\n\n","extracted_metadata":{"pdf:totalUnmappedUnicodeChars":["0"],"pdf:encrypted":["false"],"pdf:producer":["Acrobat Distiller 9.2.0

years](/wiki/Light_year \"Light year\") (700 [pc](/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\")) from [Earth](/wiki/Earth \"Earth\") in the constellation [Fornax](/wiki/Fornax \"Fornax\").\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\")\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6 \"#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6\") The star is part of the [Helmi stream](/wiki/Helmi_stream \"Helmi stream\"), a former [dwarf galaxy](/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy \"Dwarf galaxy\") that merged with the [Milky Way](/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") between six and nine billion years ago.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") As a result, HIP 13044 circles the [Galactic Center](/wiki/Galactic_Center \"Galactic Center\") at a highly irregular orbit with respect to the [galactic plane](/wiki/Galactic_plane \"Galactic plane\"). HIP 13044 is slightly less massive than the Sun, but is approximately seven times its size. The star, which is estimated to be at least nine billion years old, has passed the [red-giant](/wiki/Red_giant \"Red giant\") phase. The relatively fast rotation of the star may be due to having engulfed one or more planets during the red-giant phase.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")\n\n## Observational history\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Observational history\")\\]\nA science team from the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](/wiki/Max_Planck_Institute_for_Astronomy \"Max Planck Institute for Astronomy\") first observed HIP 13044 using [Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph](/w/index.php?title=Fiber-fed_Extended_Range_Optical_Spectrograph&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (page does not exist)\") (FEROS) at the [European Southern Observatory](/wiki/European_Southern_Observatory \"European Southern Observatory\")'s [La Silla Observatory](/wiki/La_Silla_Observatory \"La Silla Observatory\") in Chile. The first follow-up led to the collection of 36 [radial velocity](/wiki/Radial_velocity \"Radial velocity\") measurements taken between September 2009 and July 2010.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")\n\nThe team also used [photometric](</wiki/Photometry_(astronomy)> \"Photometry (astronomy)\") data that had been passively collected by and publicly released into the archive of the [SuperWASP](/wiki/SuperWASP \"SuperWASP\") collaboration, which had been observing the region where the star was located. In this data, HIP 13044 was found to oscillate; the signal was blocked roughly every sixteen days. Analysis of the SuperWASP and FEROS data led to the supposed discovery of the planet *HIP 13044 b*,\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") although this claim was later refuted.\n\n## Characteristics\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Characteristics\")\\]\nHIP 13044 is an [F-type](/wiki/Stellar_classification#Class_F \"Stellar classification\") star located approximately 701 [parsecs](/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\") (2,286 [light years](/wiki/Light_year \"Light year\")) from Earth in the [Helmi stream](/wiki/Helmi_stream \"Helmi stream\")\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")—a group of low-metallicity stars moving with large velocities relative to the Sun. The star follows an eccentric galactic orbit, with a distance from the galactic center ranging from 7 to 16 [kiloparsecs](/wiki/Kiloparsec \"Kiloparsec\").\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\") The orbit does not lie in the [galactic plane](/wiki/Galactic_plane \"Galactic plane\"), and can reach distances as high as 13 kpc above it. This indicates that it once was part of a satellite galaxy of the [Milky Way](/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") that was disrupted 6–9 billion years ago.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") The star itself is estimated to be at least nine billion years old.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\")\n\nHIP 13044 is fairly evolved star [fusing helium](/wiki/Triple-alpha_process \"Triple-alpha process\") in its core, and has therefore already passed the [red-giant](/wiki/Red_giant \"Red giant\") phase of its evolution.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") It lies near the blue end of the red horizontal branch bordering the [instability strip](/wiki/Instability_strip \"Instability strip\").\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") Its surface temperature is about 6025 K and its radius is approximately 6.7 [solar radii](/wiki/Solar_radius \"Solar radius\"). HIP 13044's mass is estimated to be 0.8 [solar masses](/wiki/Solar_mass \"Solar mass\").\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\") Having a rotation period of 5–6 days, HIP 13044 is a fast-rotating star for its type. It is possible that this is because it has swallowed planets during its red-giant phase.\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6 \"#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6\")\n\nHIP 13044 has an [apparent magnitude](/wiki/Apparent_magnitude \"Apparent magnitude\") of 9.94 and cannot be seen with the unaided eye.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\")\n\n## Claims of a planetary system\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Claims of a planetary system\")\\]\nIn 2010, it was announced that a giant planet in a 16.2-day orbit had been discovered by the radial velocity measurements. This would have had implications for planet formation in metal-poor systems and survival of planets being engulfed by expanded giant stars.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") Subsequent analysis of the data revealed problems with the detection: for example an erroneous barycentric correction had been applied (the same error had also led to claims of planets around [HIP 11952](/wiki/HIP_11952 \"HIP 11952\") that were subsequently refuted). After applying the corrections, there is no evidence for a planet orbiting the star.\\[[9]\\](#cite_note-JonesJenkins2014-9 \"#cite_note-JonesJenkins2014-9\")\n\n## References\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: References\")\\]\n\n1. ^ [***a***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-0 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-0\") [***b***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-1 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-1\") [***c***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-2 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-2\") [***d***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-3 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-3\") [***e***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-4 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-4\") [***f***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-5 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-5\") [Brown, A.

In the verse charm, Sinthgunt is referred to as the sister of the personified sun, [Sunna](</wiki/S%C3%B3l_(Germanic_mythology)> \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\") (whose name is [alliterative](/wiki/Alliterative_verse \"Alliterative verse\") to *Sinthgunt*),\\[[1]\\](#cite_note-ORCHARD112-1 \"#cite_note-ORCHARD112-1\") and the two sisters are cited as both producing incantations to heal the horse of [Phol](/wiki/Phol \"Phol\"), another otherwise unattested figure but possibly the same as [Balder](/wiki/Baldr \"Baldr\"), who is named elsewhere in the charm. The two are then followed by [Friia](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") and [Uolla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\"), also alliterative and stated as sisters.\n\nAs Sinthgunt is otherwise unattested, her significance is otherwise unknown, but some scholarly theories exist about her role in Germanic mythology based on proposed etymologies and the potential significance of her placement within the poem.\n\n## Etymology\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Etymology\")\\]\nThe etymology of *Sinthgunt* is unclear. In the original manuscript, *Sinthgunt* is spelled *Sin**ht**gunt* (emphasis added). In the 19th century, [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\") stuck strictly to this reading, proposing a complex compound based on Germanic *\\*Sin-naχt-gund*, i.e., \"the night-walking one\".\\[[2]\\](#cite_note-2 \"#cite_note-2\") As a result of the pairing with Sunna, the personified sun (corresponding to Old Norse [Sól](</wiki/S%C3%B3l_(Germanic_mythology)> \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\")), this etymology has been interpreted as a reference to the [moon](/wiki/Moon \"Moon\"). However, this reading has yielded problems; the moon in Germanic mythology is considered masculine, exemplified in the personification of the moon in [Norse mythology](/wiki/Norse_mythology \"Norse mythology\"), [Máni](/wiki/M%C3%A1ni \"Máni\"), a male figure. According to [Rudolf Simek](/wiki/Rudolf_Simek \"Rudolf Simek\"), the historical record lacks evidence for any cult of personified celestial bodies among the ancient Germanic peoples.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-3 \"#cite_note-3\")\n\nStefan Schaffner rejects this etymology, as does [Heiner Eichner](/w/index.php?title=Heiner_Eichner&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Heiner Eichner (page does not exist)\") \\[[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiner_Eichner \"de:Heiner Eichner\")\\], because the first element *Sinht-* cannot be based on the presupposed earlier Germanic *\\*sinχt-*. Such a Germanic form would have yielded Old High German *\\*sīht* by regular sound change.\\[[4]\\](#cite_note-4 \"#cite_note-4\") The amended *Sinthgunt* presupposes a Proto-Germanic compound *\\*Senþa-gunþjō*, the first element meaning \"raid, (military) campaign\", the second one \"fight\". This interpretation corresponds well to other Old High German female names such as *Sindhilt* (from *\\*Senþa-χilðijō*, with its second element also meaning \"fight\", cf. [Old Norse](/wiki/Old_Norse \"Old Norse\") *hildr*, [Old English](/wiki/Old_English \"Old English\") *hild*).\\[[5]\\](#cite_note-5 \"#cite_note-5\") Simek also mentions the interpretation \"heavenly body, star\".\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-SIMEK285-286-6 \"#cite_note-SIMEK285-286-6\")\n\n## Placement\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Placement\")\\]\nThe figures [Fulla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\") (*Uolla*) and [Frigg](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") (*Friia*) are attested together in later Old Norse sources (though not as sisters), and theories have been proposed that Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. This notion has resulted in a theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of Sinthgunt and Sunna/Sól, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-BOSTOCK29-7 \"#cite_note-BOSTOCK29-7\") Similarly, [Wolfgang Beck](/w/index.php?title=Wolfgang_Beck&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Wolfgang Beck (page does not exist)\") \\[[de](<https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Beck_(Germanist)> \"de:Wolfgang Beck (Germanist)\")\\] analysed her as a subordinate goddess from Sunna's retinue, a kind of \"situation goddess\", based on her unique appearance in the sources.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-8 \"#cite_note-8\")\n\n[Friedrich Kauffmann](/wiki/Friedrich_Kauffmann \"Friedrich Kauffmann\") classified Sinhtgunt as a [valkyrie](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\") in the 19th century, because the elements *-gund* and *-hild* appear frequently in their names.\\[[9]\\](#cite_note-9 \"#cite_note-9\") Stefan Schaffner and Heiner Eichner more recently agreed with him, based on Günter Müller's paper on the valkyries' healing powers.\\[[10]\\](#cite_note-10 \"#cite_note-10\")\n\n[Karl Helm](/wiki/Karl_Helm \"Karl Helm\") rejected Kauffmann and grouped Sinhtgunt with the [Idisi](/wiki/Idisi \"Idisi\") of the [First Merseburg Charm](/wiki/First_Merseburg_Charm \"First Merseburg Charm\"), as a specially defined group of Germanic goddesses.\\[[11]\\](#cite_note-11 \"#cite_note-11\")\n\n## Notes\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Notes\")\\]\n\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-ORCHARD112_1-0 \"#cite_ref-ORCHARD112_1-0\")** Orchard (1997:112).\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-2 \"#cite_ref-2\")** [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\"). *Studien über die Entstehung der nordischen Götter- und Heldensagen*.

But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war,\nif you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that\nAntichrist--I really believe he is Antichrist--I will have nothing more\nto do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my 'faithful\nslave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened\nyou--sit down and tell me all the news.\"\n\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna\nScherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With\nthese words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and\nimportance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna\nhad had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la\ngrippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the\nelite.\n\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered\nby a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n\n\"If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the\nprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,\nI shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10--Annette\nScherer.\"\n\n\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the least\ndisconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an\nembroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on\nhis breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that\nrefined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and\nwith the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance\nwho had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna,\nkissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,\nand complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n\n\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's mind\nat rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and\naffected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be\ndiscerned.\n\n\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like\nthese if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You are staying the\nwhole evening, I hope?\"\n\n\"And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I must\nput in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is coming for\nme to take me there.\"\n\n\"I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these\nfestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\n\n\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been\nput off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit\nsaid things he did not even wish to be believed.\n\n\"Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's\ndispatch? You know everything.\"\n\n\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold, listless\ntone. \"What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has\nburnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.\"\n\n","extracted_metadata":{"X-TIKA:Parsed-By":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.csv.TextAndCSVParser"],"Content-Encoding":["ISO-8859-1"],"X-TIKA:Parsed-By-Full-Set":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.csv.TextAndCSVParser"],"resourceName":["book-war-and-peace-1p.txt"],"Content-Length":["3045"],"Content-Type":["text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1"]},"metadata_field_count":6,"attempts":1,"timestamp":1752386778.56689,"platform":"Linux","python_version":"3.13.5"},{"file_path":"test_documents/text/selected_pdfs.txt","file_size":2374,"file_type":"txt","category":"tiny","framework":"extractous","iteration":1,"extraction_time":0.05156278610229492,"startup_time":null,"peak_memory_mb":447.33203125,"avg_memory_mb":447.33203125,"peak_cpu_percent":93.5,"avg_cpu_percent":26.339999999999996,"total_io_mb":null,"status":"success","character_count":2375,"word_count":337,"error_type":null,"error_message":null,"quality_metrics":{"char_count":2375,"word_count":337,"sentence_count":46,"paragraph_count":6,"avg_word_length":6.029673590504451,"avg_sentence_length":7.913043478260869,"extraction_completeness":1.0,"text_coherence":0.8260869565217391,"noise_ratio":0.0,"gibberish_ratio":0.13924050632911392,"flesch_reading_ease":31.25250179629964,"gunning_fog_index":13.869193461469374,"has_proper_formatting":true,"maintains_line_breaks":true,"preserves_whitespace":false,"table_structure_preserved":false,"format_specific_score":0.0,"expected_content_preserved":false},"overall_quality_score":0.43308736637580936,"extracted_text":"# Selected PDFs for Benchmarking\n\n## Small PDFs (< 100KB)\n1.

He moved to Huddersfield Town in 1990 where he remained\nfor three seasons before transferring to Leicester City. Roberts signed for Wolverhampton\nWanderers after three further seasons, but stayed for a single campaign before transferring\nto Norwich City, where he spent seven years. He played international football for Wales and\namassed fifteen caps between 1989 and 2001, without scoring.\nRoberts made 647 league appearances during his career, almost half of which were for\nNorwich, where he overcame a weak start to become a fan favourite. At his peak, he scored\n61 goals in three seasons, and finished with two goals in his final game as Norwich achieved\npromotion to the Premiership. He was elected to the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame in\n2002, while still at the club. His professional career ended with spells at Gillingham and on\nloan to Cambridge United.\nSince retiring as a player, Roberts, who speaks fluent Welsh, has worked as a commentator\nfor Sky Sports, BBC Radio Cymru and BBC Cymru Wales. His book, All I Want for\nChristmas ..., a reference to his gap-toothed appearance, prompted both controversy and\npraise when it was published in 2004.\nIwan Wyn Roberts was born in Bangor, Gwynedd, on 26 June 1968,[1] and grew up in\nBarmouth, on the west coast of Wales as a Liverpool fan.[2]\nRoberts says that most football fans would know him (\"if you know me at all\") as \"that gaptoothed ginger lunk\".[3] He started losing his front tooth when he was just 10: his best\nfriend's heel chipping half of his tooth off, the result of an incident playing football.[4] Some\nyears later, a dentist removed the stump when an abscess developed.[4] He lost his second\nfront tooth as the result of an elbow to the mouth from Darran Rowbotham when he was\n18,[5]\n playing for Watford in a pre-season friendly.[4]\nEarly life\n2005 â�� Cambridge United (loan) 11 (3)\nTotal 647 (202)\nInternational career\n1989â��2001 Wales 15 (0)\n1994 Wales B 1 (1)\nManagerial career\n2004 Gillingham (joint-caretaker)\n*Club domestic league appearances and goals\nRoberts credits his school PE teacher, Iolo Owen, as a great influence in his career,\nintroducing him into men's football aged 15: \"He picked me for the school team and got me\ninto the local men's team, Harlech Town ... as he was the manager ... it toughened me up\nand made me a lot stronger.\"[6] Critical to Roberts' thinking when he joined Watford was\nthat coach Tom Walley was, like himself, Welsh-speaking, as was professional Malcolm\nAllen, against whom Roberts had played in the local Welsh leagues.[7] He was also\ninfluenced by Graham Taylor's record of giving youth players opportunities.[8] Roberts\njoined Watford as a trainee, signing his first professional contract in July 1986, shortly after\nhis 18th birthday.[9]\nRoberts made his first-team debut during the 1985â��86 season and scored his first goal in professional football on 16 September 1986; it was the\nonly goal in a 1â��0 win against Manchester United at Vicarage Road.\n[10] Having made only one full first team appearance for Watford prior to the\nmatch, Roberts came on as a second-half substitute to score the winning goal from a narrow angle.[11] Watford ended the season in ninth\nposition,[12] and despite having three years of his contract remaining, Taylor left the club to join Aston Villa.\n[13] Roberts broke through in the\nfollowing season, making 31 appearances in all competitions and scoring three goals, but Watford finished 19th in the table and were relegated to\nthe Second Division.\n[14][15] The 1988â��89 season saw him make 32 appearances in total, scoring six goals,[16] with Watford finishing fourth, but\nfailing to progress past the 1989 Football League play-offs.\n[17] Roberts' chances were restricted the following season, when he made just nine\nleague appearances, scoring twice.[18]\nHe scored nine goals in 63 league matches in total for Watford,[19] but felt that he was failing to get enough opportunities and moved to Division\nThree club Huddersfield Town prior to the start of the 1990â��91 season, for Â£275,000.[8][19][20] One of his contemporaries at Watford was future\nNorwich City manager, Glenn Roeder. Roberts remembers Roeder as \"an absolute gentleman ... I can't speak highly enough of him. He helped me\na great deal with his experience and any problems that the young lads had they knew he would help them with.\"[21]\nRoberts credits a lot of his success as a striker to the interaction he had with Huddersfield's then first-team coach, Peter Withe: \"Peter was\nexceptional in the air and he taught me so much on how to use my physicality properly and how to move defenders about especially in the penalty\nbox which would enable me a bit more time and space in the box.\"[22] The club then signed Frank Stapleton, who helped the young Roberts\ndevelop \"awareness in the opposition's penalty box\" and how to \"steal goals\" to increase his goal tally, getting a final touch to 'help' a goalbound\nball cross the line.[22]\nThe 1991â��92 season brought Roberts a club post-war record 34 goals in a season, 24 of which were in the league, making him joint top-scorer in\nthe division.[2][8][23] His efforts helped the club to finish third and qualify for the play-offs.\n[24] There they lost to Peterborough United where\nRoberts failed to score in either leg.[8][25] Overall, whilst playing for Huddersfield he scored 50 goals in 142 games.[26][27][28][29]\nIn November\nClub career\nWatford\nHuddersfield Town\n1993 he was signed by the Second Division club Leicester City for Â£300,000.[19][30] Neil Warnock, Huddersfield's manager, needed to sell players\nand Leicester manager Brian Little took an interest.[31]\nRoberts made his debut for Leicester in a Midlands derby against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n[31] At half time, Leicester were two goals behind\nand he expected manager Brian Little, \"the nicest man\" he ever played for to rant in the dressing room, but instead he quietly told the players he\nwas going to make two substitutions.[32]\nIn the second half, Roberts scored two goals to secure a draw.[32] After retiring, Roberts said he still\nregretted not completing a hat-trick in the match, a feat he did achieve in April 1994, in a 28-minute spell against local rivals Derby County.\n[31] As\nrecently as 2017, this achievement is still recalled in a chant by Leicester City fans.[33] Roberts broke some ribs a few weeks later and returned to\nthe first-team squad just in time for the 1993â��94 play-off final, which Leicester won 2â��1 against Derby.[31]\nIn the 1994â��95 Premiership, Leicester struggled and were relegated, but Roberts was the club's top scorer with 11 goals in all competitions.[31][34]\nHe scored another 19 goals the following season, as Leicester reached the play-offs again.[35]\nIn the semi-final, Leicester drew 0-0 with Stoke City\nin the first leg at home and won 1-0 in the second leg from a Garry Parker goal, to qualify for the final.\n[36] What followed was one of the only two\nincidents that \"bugged\" Roberts during his playing career: while celebrating the win, he suddenly realised he was in danger due to a pitch invasion\nby Stoke supporters.[36] He managed to escape, but some of his team-mates, including Neil Lennon and Muzzy Izzet were less fortunate, and had\nto be protected by police.[36][37] Although it was reported that Roberts had recovered from injury,[38] he was not selected for the squad for the\nplay-off final against Crystal Palace. Leicester won the match which secured them promotion to the Premiership.[35] With the side promoted again,\nLeicester decided to sell Roberts to Wolves.[31] In all, Roberts scored 41 goals in 100 league games for Leicester.[19]\nHis goals and performances for Leicester persuaded Wolves to sign Roberts for Â£1.3m in the summer of 1996.[39] He spent only one season at\nMolineux in which he scored 12 goals in 33 games, including one hat-trick for the club in a match against their local rivals West Bromwich Albion\nin the Black Country derby.\n[39][40] Wolves ended the season in third place but lost 4â��3 on aggregate to Crystal Palace in the play-offs, with Roberts\nfailing to score in either leg.[41]\nIn the summer off-season of 1997, Roberts returned from holiday and came into the club for the first day of pre-season training where manager\nMark McGhee called him into his office. There McGhee said that he had been told that in order to bring in new players, he had to sell first, and that\nRoberts was the only player for whom an offer had been made â�� by Norwich City.[42] Roberts did not want to leave the club, but accepted that if\nthe manager did not want him there, he needed to go.[42]\nIn July 1997, Norwich City manager Mike Walker paid Â£850,000 to Wolves to secure the services of Roberts.[43] His time at the club (nicknamed\nthe Canaries) did not begin happily, however. Following his debut in August 1997 against his former club Wolves, he struggled throughout the\n1997â��98 season and scored just seven goals; \"there were certainly those in the stands who were questioning whether he was worth the near\nÂ£1,000,000 splashed out on him\".[44] There were crowd chants about him being a \"waste of money\" and Roberts remembers that someone wrote\nLeicester City\nWolverhampton Wanderers\nNorwich City\nto the Eastern Daily Press and described him as \"the worst ever to wear a Norwich shirt\", adding the reflection that \"it was the bleakest period of\nall my years as a pro.\"[42] Roberts had scored just four goals heading into the end of the season; however, his fitness slowly began to improve and\n\"three goals in the final two home games of the season left in good heart for the next campaign\".[44] Walker was sacked at the end of the season,\nand Roberts blames himself for this happening â�� a result of his lack of goals.[42]\nWalker was replaced during the summer by Bruce Rioch. During pre-season training, Roberts weighed in at 15 stone 3 pounds (97 kg), with a body\nfat ratio of 16â��17%, when his \"fighting weight\" should have been \"just under 14 stone with around 13 per cent body fat.\"[45] The turnaround was,\naccording to Roberts, due to some clever psychology by Rioch:\n\"Bruce was very clever: he didn't issue me with an ultimatum, he didn't rant and rave or threaten me. He just said, \"Tom Walley would\nbe proud of you\". Tom was my youth team manager at Watford and absolutely hated people being out of shape ... It was a gentle hint,\nbut I realised ... I had to sort it out myself.\"[45]\nRoberts threw himself into weight training and soon reached a target weight of 13 stone 10 pounds.[45]\nIt paid off: that season, Roberts scored 23\ngoals.[44] He was partnered by what the Eastern Daily Press described as the \"flourishing talent\" of Craig Bellamy who scored 19 goals. Norwich\nfinished in the top half of the table and the Canaries fans voted Roberts player of the season.\n[44]\nIn the 1999â��2000 season he was again top scorer\n(19 goals in 49 games) and retained the player of the season award. He just missed out on becoming the first player in the club's history to win the\naward three years in a row when Andy Marshall finished narrowly ahead of him in the voting for the 2000â��01 season.\n[46]\nDuring that 1999â��2000 campaign there was speculation about Roberts's future as his contract was due to expire in the summer of 2000.[47]\nRoberts had an agent, former team-mate and close friend David Speedie, who advised him to turn down Norwich's offer and sign for Nottingham\nForest or Huddersfield Town. Ultimately, \"he couldn't produce anything on paper that told me I'd be signing ... so I could have got injured in\ntraining, never played again and not got a penny.\"[47] As a result, the two men fell out and Roberts did not use the services of an agent again,\nrepresenting himself in contract negotiations.[47] Shortly after he signed a contract extension in January of that season, Bruce Rioch left the club\nand was succeeded by Bryan Hamilton. Roberts helped Hamilton make a good start when he scored both goals in a 2â��0 win at Portman Road\nagainst City's East Anglian derby rivals Ipswich Town on 19 March 2000.[48]\nAlthough Roberts was personally enjoying the most productive spell of his career, his first four years at Carrow Road had seen the club struggle.\nThey had barely threatened to qualify for the end of season play-offs, ending the 2000â��01 campaign in 15th place, six points above the relegation\nzone.[49] The 2001â��02 season, with new manager Nigel Worthington in his first full season in charge,[50] saw the team fare better and they\nreached the Division One play-off final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.\n[51] Roberts missed much of the second half of the season because of\ninjury, but came off the substitute's bench in the final to give Norwich the lead in the first minute of extra-time with a header. Norwich lost the\nmatch in a penalty shoot-out after Birmingham City had equalised. Roberts took â�� and scored â�� the first penalty of the shoot-out but misses by\nPhil Mulryne and Daryl Sutch meant Birmingham won 4â��2 and were promoted to the Premiership.[52]\nDuring the 2002â��03 season, Roberts captained the Norwich team. That season, in a match against Sheffield Wednesday at Carrow Road, Roberts\nscored twice to move into third place on the list of Norwich City's all-time leading goalscorers, overtaking Robert Fleck in the process.[53] The\nCanaries faded after a good start to the season, finishing in eighth place and failing to qualify for the play-offs.[54] Roberts scored just 7 goals in 47\ngames.[55] The 2003â��04 season would be his last at Carrow Road and although he was no longer an regular starter for the first team he played an\nUnder Nigel Worthington,\nRoberts became club\ncaptain, but also finished his\nNorwich City career.\nimportant part in one of the club's best-ever seasons. The team won the title and were promoted to the\nPremiership.[56] Roberts scored some important goals, including the winning strike in a top-of-the-table match\nagainst Sheffield United.\n[57] Roberts revealed in his autobiography that in February of that season he had a cancer\nscare and had to have a malignant melanoma removed from his arm.[58]\nA few days before the club's last home match of the 2003â��04 season, Worthington announced that Roberts would not\nbe offered a new contract when his deal expired that summer. Worthington felt that, following promotion to the\nPremiership, the club had to look to the future and that Roberts was now surplus to requirements.[59] Although he\nhad made 41 league appearances that season, he started just 13 games.[60] With the championship already won,\nWorthington restored Roberts to the starting line-up for the last game of the season at Gresty Road against Crewe\nAlexandra and made him captain for the day. Roberts scored twice as City won 3â��1;[61] he described the occasion and\nthe goal: \"I'd never scored on the final day of a season before, it was my final game in a Norwich shirt, which was a\nvery sad occasion, Nigel Worthington made me captain for the day and I'll be forever thankful for that, and I managed\nto cap it all off by getting two goals. One of them was a left footed volley into the top corner and I haven't got too\nmany of those in my career!\"[2]\n Overall, Roberts scored 96 goals in 306 games for Norwich.[61]\nAfter being released by Norwich, he received a number of offers to play for other clubs, including from Swiss side FC\nBasel, but eventually signed a two-year contract with Gillingham of the Championship, where he would be\nplayer/coach.[59] His debut was against Ipswich, Norwich's local rivals, and was booked after less than five seconds.[5] The move to Gillingham did\nnot prove a good one for him and he had a number of disagreements with the club, particularly with Stan Ternent after he succeeded Andy\nHessenthaler as manager.[5][62]\nIn December 2004 Roberts had himself served as joint caretaker manager, along with Darren Hare and Paul\nSmith, after the sudden departure of both Hessenthaler and initial caretaker John Gorman.\n[5]\nIn March 2005 he joined Cambridge United on loan\nuntil the end of the season to play under the management of former Norwich team-mate, Rob Newman.\n[2] He scored his 200th league goal on his\ndebut,[5] but Cambridge were relegated from League Two.[63] In August 2005, Roberts retired from playing after reaching an agreement with\nGillingham to pay the final year of his contract.[62]\nWhile a Watford player, Roberts was called up for Wales for the first time, an April 1989 friendly game against Israel.\n[64] He made his debut for the\nWelsh national team on 11 October 1989, when he took to the field in a 2â��1 defeat to the Netherlands in a World Cup qualifier at the Racecourse\nGround, Wrexham. With both Ian Rush and Mark Hughes suspended, Roberts started the game alongside Malcolm Allen.[65] He had to wait more\nthan two years for his next international appearance, when his domestic form for Huddersfield saw him leading scorer in Division Two.[23] Roberts\nplayed in a 1â��1 friendly against Austria in April 1992.[66] He earned two more caps that year at the Kirin Cup in Japan, suffering a 1â��0 loss against\nArgentina and receiving a red card in a 1â��0 victory over the host nation for a foul on Masami Ihara.\n[66][67] Roberts made three appearances for the\nsenior Wales team in 1994, including two qualification matches for UEFA Euro 1996 against Albania and Moldova.\n[66] He was not selected for\nWales again until 2000 when he made three appearances in friendlies, all losses against Finland, Brazil and Portugal.\n[66]\nGillingham and Cambridge United\nInternational career\nBellamy playing for Wales\nin 2011\nRoberts made four more appearances for his country in the qualification stages for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in 2000 and 2001.\n[66] He won a total\nof 15 caps for his country over a 12-year period, including a single appearance and one goal for the Wales B team,[68] but failed to score for the\nsenior team.[66] Roberts is phlegmatic that he made only 17 appearances (\"most as substitute\") for Wales, as he \"had to compete against the likes\nof Mark Hughes, Ian Rush, Dean Saunders, so there were some world-class strikers before me and I was just happy to get in the squad.\"[2] He\nregards the fact that he did not score for Wales as the greatest regret of his career.[69]\nStanding at 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m),[1] Roberts was known for scoring a high proportion of his goals with headers.[70] He had\na strong partnership with Craig Bellamy, beginning when Bellamy broke into the Norwich first team in 1997, aged\n18.[71] They also featured together for Wales, although Roberts never managed to score in 15 appearances for the\nnational side. Roberts said \"I absolutely loved playing up-front with [Bellamy] ... we hit it off straight away, probably\nmore so than anyone else I ever played with. It was like telepathy between us.\"[69] He described the relationship as \"the\nclassic big man, little man\" and noted that in their first season together for Norwich, Roberts scored 24 goals and\nBellamy 17.[69]\nIn 2004, Roberts published an account of his last season at Norwich, entitled All I want for Christmas .... The title of\nthe book was a joke based on Roberts' missing front teeth, a reference to the song \"All I Want for Christmas Is My Two\nFront Teeth\".[5] The book proved controversial, because it included an admission of a deliberate stamp on Wolves\ndefender Kevin Muscat, an incident that had taken place in 2000:\n\"As I got up I 'lost my balance' and trod on his back. Fourteen stone through eight studs, you do the maths.\nHe was in agony, but the ref didn't see it so I got away with it. Of course, I pulled him up and said 'Sorry\nmate, sorry mate', but he knew.\"[72]\nRoberts stated in the book that the stamp was a payback for a serious injury that Muscat had inflicted on Craig Bellamy while Bellamy and Roberts\nwere playing together for Norwich, and that Muscat held no grudges over it.[73]\nBecause of the coverage in the book, the Football Association retrospectively investigated the incident and Roberts, then playing at Gillingham,\nwas banned for three matches and fined Â£2,500 for the offence.[74] Roberts commented that this \"left 'a bitter taste' â�� especially after England\ncaptain David Beckham escaped without a punishment for his deliberate foul in the World Cup qualifier against Wales.\"[75] The Football\nAssociation said there was \"insufficient evidence\" to charge Beckham with bringing the game into disrepute. This was \"despite his admission in\nStyle of play\nAll I Want for Christmas ...\nIwan Roberts appearances, goals and scoring rate\nThe Daily Telegraph and subsequent apology.\"[76] At the time, Roberts told The Daily Telegraph, \"I do not want players to get suspensions and\nfines, but there must be consistency, regardless of who the player is.\"[76] The book was praised by critics. The Daily Telegraph called it \"a rollicking\ngood read. If it doesn't make you at least smile, then it's time to seek counselling.\"[77]\nRoberts has the UEFA A Licence for football coaching and, speaking in 2007, had not ruled out getting into management. He told the Eastern\nDaily Press, \"I've done my qualifications. It's just getting a club to give me a chance and taking it.\"[21] When Norwich sacked Nigel Worthington,\nRoberts applied for the manager's job. \"I tried to go for it ... knowing I wasn't going to get it but I'd never really been for an interview and I thought\nif I did it would stand me in good stead. But I never got a response from the club and that really disappointed me. A week after Peter Grant got the\njob I got a letter through the post saying 'We won't be considering you this time'.

in Germanic mythology, attested solely in the Old High German 9th- or 10th-century Second Merseburg Charm. In the verse charm, Sinthgunt is referred to as the sister of the personified sun, Sunna (whose name is alliterative to Sinthgunt),[1] and the two sisters are cited as both producing incantations to heal the horse of Phol, another otherwise unattested figure but possibly the same as Balder, who is named elsewhere in the charm. The two are then followed by Friia and Uolla, also alliterative and stated as sisters.\n\nAs Sinthgunt is otherwise unattested, her significance is otherwise unknown, but some scholarly theories exist about her role in Germanic mythology based on proposed etymologies and the potential significance of her placement within the poem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtymology\n[edit]\n\nThe etymology of Sinthgunt is unclear.  In the original manuscript, Sinthgunt is spelled Sinhtgunt (emphasis added). In the 19th century, Sophus Bugge stuck strictly to this reading, proposing a complex compound based on Germanic *Sin-naχt-gund, i.e., \"the night-walking one\".[2] As a result of the pairing with Sunna, the personified sun (corresponding to Old Norse Sól), this etymology has been interpreted as a reference to the moon. However, this reading has yielded problems; the moon in Germanic mythology is considered masculine, exemplified in the personification of the moon in Norse mythology, Máni, a male figure. According to Rudolf Simek, the historical record lacks evidence for any cult of personified celestial bodies among the ancient Germanic peoples.[3]\n\nStefan Schaffner rejects this etymology, as does Heiner Eichner [de], because the first element Sinht- cannot be based on the presupposed earlier Germanic *sinχt-. Such a Germanic form would have yielded Old High German *sīht by regular sound change.[4] The amended Sinthgunt presupposes a Proto-Germanic compound *Senþa-gunþjō, the first element meaning \"raid, (military) campaign\", the second one \"fight\". This interpretation corresponds well to other Old High German female names such as Sindhilt (from *Senþa-χilðijō, with its second element also meaning \"fight\", cf. Old Norse hildr, Old English hild).[5] Simek also mentions the interpretation \"heavenly body, star\".[6]\n\n\nPlacement\n[edit]\n\nThe figures Fulla (Uolla) and Frigg (Friia) are attested together in later Old Norse sources (though not as sisters), and theories have been proposed that Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. This notion has resulted in a theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of Sinthgunt and Sunna/Sól, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.[7] Similarly, Wolfgang Beck [de] analysed her as a subordinate goddess from Sunna's retinue, a kind of \"situation goddess\", based on her unique appearance in the sources.[8]\n\nFriedrich Kauffmann classified Sinhtgunt as a valkyrie in the 19th century, because the elements -gund and -hild appear frequently in their names.[9] Stefan Schaffner and Heiner Eichner more recently agreed with him, based on Günter Müller's paper on the valkyries' healing powers.[10] \n\nKarl Helm rejected Kauffmann and grouped Sinhtgunt with the Idisi of the First Merseburg Charm, as a specially defined group of Germanic goddesses.[11]\n\n\nNotes\n[edit]\n\n\n\t^ Orchard (1997:112).\n\n\t^ Sophus Bugge.

Kernighan\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMuch of the power of the UNIX operating system comes from a style of program\ndesign that makes programs easy to use and, more important, easy to combine with other\nprograms. This style has been called the use of software tools, and depends more on how\nthe programs fit into the programming environment � how they can be used with other\nprograms � than on how they are designed internally. But as the system has become\ncommercially successful and has spread widely, this style has often been compromised, to\nthe detriment of all users. Old programs have become encrusted with dubious features.\nNewer programs are not always written with attention to proper separation of function\nand design for interconnection. This paper discusses the elements of program design,\nshowing by example good and bad design, and indicates some possible trends for the\nfuture.\n\nThe UNIX operating system has become a great commercial success, and is likely to be the standard\noperating system for microcomputers and some mainframes in the coming years.\n\nThere are good reasons for this popularity. One is portability: the operating system kernel and the\napplications programs are written in the programming language C, and thus can be moved from one type of\ncomputer to another with much less effort than would be involved in recreating them in the assembly lan-\nguage of each machine. Essentially the same operating system therefore runs on a wide variety of comput-\ners, and users needn’t learn a new system when new hardware comes along. Perhaps more important, ven-\ndors that sell the UNIX system needn’t provide new software for each new machine; instead, their software\ncan be compiled and run without change on any hardware, which makes the system commercially attrac-\ntive. There is also an element of zealotry: users of the system tend to be enthusiastic and to expect it wher-\never they go; the students who used the UNIX system in university a few years ago are now in the job mar-\nket and often demand it as a condition of employment.\n\nBut the UNIX system was popular long before it was even portable, let alone a commercial success.\nThe reasons for that are more interesting.\n\nExcept for the initial PDP-7 version, the UNIX system was written for the DEC PDP-11, a machine that\nwas (deservedly) very popular. PDP-11’s were powerful enough to do real computing, but small enough to\nbe affordable by small organizations such as academic departments in universities.\n\nThe early UNIX system was smaller but more effective and technically more interesting than compet-\ning systems on the same hardware. It provided a number of innovative applications of computer science,\nshowing the benefits to be obtained by a judicious blend of theory and practice. Examples include the\nyacc parser-generator, the diff file comparison program, and the pervasive use of regular expressions to\ndescribe string patterns. These led in turn to new programming languages and interesting software for\napplications like program development, document preparation and circuit design.\n\nSince the system was modest in size, and since essentially everything was written in C, the software\nwas easy to modify, to customize for particular applications or merely to support a view of the world\n__________________\n UNIX is a trademark of Bell Laboratories.\n\n\n\n- 2 -\n\ndifferent from the original. (This ease of change is also a weakness, of course, as evidenced by the plethora\nof different versions of the system.)\n\nFinally, the UNIX system provided a new style of computing, a new way of thinking of how to attack\na problem with a computer. This style was based on the use of tools: using programs separately or in com-\nbination to get a job done, rather than doing it by hand, by monolithic self-sufficient subsystems, or by\nspecial-purpose, one-time programs. This has been much discussed in the literature, so we don’t need to\nrepeat it here; see [1], for example.\n\nThe style of use and design of the tools on the system are closely related. The style is still evolving,\nand is the subject of this essay: in particular, how the design and use of a program fit together, how the\ntools fit into the environment, and how the style influences solutions to new problems. The focus of the\ndiscussion is a single example, the program cat, which concatenates a set of files onto its standard output.\ncat is a simple program, both in implementation and in use; it is essential to the UNIX system; and it is a\ngood illustration of the kinds of decisions that delight both supporters and critics of the system. (Often a\nsingle property of the system will be taken as an asset or as a fault by different audiences; our audience is\nprogrammers, because the UNIX environment is designed fundamentally for programming.) Even the\nname cat is typical of UNIX program names: it is short, pronounceable, but not conventional English for\nthe job it does. (For an opposing viewpoint, see [2].) Most important, though, cat in its usages and varia-\ntions exemplifies UNIX program design style and how it has been interpreted by different communities.\n\n11/3/71 CAT (I)\n\nNAME c_a_t_ -- concatenate and print\n\nSYNOPSIS c_a_t_ f_i_l_e_1_ ...\n\nDESCRIPTION c_a_t_ reads each file in sequence and writes it on\nthe standard output stream. Thus:\n\nc_a_t_ f_i_l_e_\n\nis about the easiest way to print a file. Also:\n\nc_a_t_ f_i_l_e_1_ f_i_l_e_2_ >f_i_l_e_3_\n\nis about the easiest way to concatenate files.\n\nIf no input file is given c_a_t_ reads from the\nstandard input file.\n\nFILES --\n\nSEE ALSO pr, cp\n\nDIAGNOSTICS none; if a file cannot be found it is ignored.\n\nBUGS --\n\nOWNER ken, dmr\n\nFigure 1: Manual page for cat, UNIX 1st Edition, November, 1971\n\nFigure 1 is the manual page for cat from the UNIX 1st Edition manual. Evidently, cat copies its input to\nits output. The input is normally taken from a sequence of one or more files, but it can come from the stan-\ndard input. The output is the standard output. The manual suggests two uses, the general file copy:\n\n\n\n- 3 -\n\ncat file1 file2 >file3\n\nand printing a file on the terminal:\n\ncat file\n\nThe general case is certainly what was intended in the design of the program. Output redirection (provided\nby the > operator, implemented by the UNIX shell) makes cat a fine general-purpose file concatenator and\na valuable adjunct for other programs, which can use cat to process filenames, as in:\n\ncat file file2 ... | other-program\n\nThe fact that cat will also print on the terminal is a special case. Perhaps surprisingly, in practice it turns\nout that the special case is the main use of the program. \n\nThe design of cat is typical of most UNIX programs: it implements one simple but general function\nthat can be used in many different applications (including many not envisioned by the original author).\nOther commands are used for other functions. For example, there are separate commands for file system\ntasks like renaming files, deleting them or telling how big they are. Other systems instead lump these into a\nsingle ‘‘file system’’ command with an internal structure and command language of its own. (The PIP file\ncopy program found on operating systems like CP/M or RSX-11 is an example.) That approach is not neces-\nsarily worse or better, but it is certainly against the UNIX philosophy. Unfortunately, such programs are\nnot completely alien to the UNIX system � some mail-reading programs and text editors, for example, are\nlarge self-contained ‘‘subsystems’’ that provide their own complete environments and mesh poorly with the\nrest of the system. Most such subsystems, however, are usually imported from or inspired by programs on\nother operating systems with markedly different programming environments.\n\nThere are some significant advantages to the traditional UNIX system approach. The most important\nis that the surrounding environment � the shell and the programs it can invoke � provides a uniform\naccess to system facilities. Filename argument patterns are expanded by the shell for all programs, without\nprearrangement in each command. The same is true of input and output redirection. Pipes are a natural\noutgrowth of redirection. Rather than decorate each command with options for all relevant pre- and post-\nprocessing, each program expects as input, and produces as output, concise and header-free textual data that\nconnects well with other programs to do the rest of the task at hand. It takes some programming discipline\nto build a program that works well in this environment � primarily, to avoid the temptation to add features\nthat conflict with or duplicate services provided by other commands � but it’s well worthwhile.\n\nGrowth is easy when the functions are well separated. For example, the 7th Edition shell was aug-\nmented with a backquote operator that converts the output of one program into the arguments to another, as\nin\n\ncat ‘cat filelist‘\n\nNo changes were made in any other program when this operator was invented; because the backquote is\ninterpreted by the shell, all programs called by the shell acquire the feature transparently and uniformly. If\nspecial characters like backquotes were instead interpreted, even by calling a standard subroutine, by each\nprogram that found the feature appropriate, every program would require (at least) recompilation whenever\nsomeone had a new idea. Not only would uniformity be hard to enforce, but experimentation would be\nharder because of the effort of installing any changes.\n\nThe UNIX 7th Edition system introduced two changes in cat. First, files that could not be read,\neither because of denied permissions or simple non-existence, were reported rather than ignored. Second,\nand less desirable, was the addition of a single optional argument -u, which forced cat to unbuffer its out-\nput (the reasons for this option, which has disappeared again in the 8th Edition of the system, are technical\nand irrelevant here.)\n\nBut the existence of one argument was enough to suggest more, and other versions of the system\n__________________\n The use of cat to feed a single input file to a program has to some degree superseded the shell’s < operator, which illus-\ntrates that general-purpose constructs � like cat and pipes � are often more natural than convenient special-purpose\nones.\n\n\n\n- 4 -\n\nsoon embellished cat with features. This list comes from cat on the Berkeley distribution of the UNIX\nsystem:\n\n-s strip multiple blank lines to a single instance\n-n number the output lines\n-b number only the non-blank lines\n-v make non-printing characters visible\n\n-ve mark ends of lines\n-vt change representation of tab\n\nIn System V, there are similar options and even a clash of naming: -s instructs cat to be silent\nabout non-existent files. But none of these options are appropriate additions to cat; the reasons get to the\nheart of how UNIX programs are designed and why they work well together.\n\nIt’s easy to dispose of (Berkeley) -s, -n and -b: all of these jobs are readily done with existing tools\nlike sed and awk. For example, to number lines, this awk invocation suffices:\n\nawk ’{ print NR \"\\t\" $0 }’ filenames\n\nIf line-numbering is needed often, this command can be packaged under a name like linenumber and put\nin a convenient public place. Another possibility is to modify the pr command, whose job is to format text\nsuch as program source for output on a line printer. Numbering lines is an appropriate feature in pr; in fact\nUNIX System V pr has a -n option to do so. There never was a need to modify cat; these options are\ngratuitous tinkering.\n\nBut what about -v? That prints non-printing characters in a visible representation. Making strange\ncharacters visible is a genuinely new function, for which no existing program is suitable. (‘‘sed -n l’’,\nthe closest standard possibility, aborts when given very long input lines, which are more likely to occur in\nfiles containing non-printing characters.) So isn’t it appropriate to add the -v option to cat to make\nstrange characters visible when a file is printed?\n\nThe answer is ‘‘No.’’ Such a modification confuses what cat’s job is � concatenating files � with\nwhat it happens to do in a common special case � showing a file on the terminal. A UNIX program\nshould do one thing well, and leave unrelated tasks to other programs. cat’s job is to collect the data in\nfiles. Programs that collect data shouldn’t change the data; cat therefore shouldn’t transform its input.\n\nThe preferred approach in this case is a separate program that deals with non-printable characters.\nWe called ours vis (a suggestive, pronounceable, non-English name) because its job is to make things vis-\nible. As usual, the default is to do what most users will want � make strange characters visible � and as\nnecessary include options for variations on that theme. By making vis a separate program, related useful\nfunctions are easy to provide. For example, the option -s strips out (i.e., discards) strange characters,\nwhich is handy for dealing with files from other operating systems. Other options control the treatment and\nformat of characters like tabs and backspaces that may or may not be considered strange in different situa-\ntions. Such options make sense in vis because its focus is entirely on the treatment of such characters. In\ncat, they require an entire sub-language within the -v option, and thus get even further away from the\nfundamental purpose of that program. Also, providing the function in a separate program makes conve-\nnient options such as -s easier to invent, because it isolates the problem as well as the solution.\n\nOne possible objection to separate programs for each task is efficiency. For example, if we want\nnumbered lines and visible characters it is probably more efficient to run the one command\n\ncat -n -v file\n\nthan the two-element pipeline\n\nlinenumber file | vis\n\nIn practice, however, cat is usually used with no options, so it makes sense to have the common cases be\nthe efficient ones. The current research version of the cat command is actually about five times faster\nthan the Berkeley and System V versions because it can process data in large blocks instead of the byte-at-\ntime processing that might be required if an option is enabled. Also, and this is perhaps more important, it\nis hard to imagine any of these examples being the bottleneck of a production program. Most of the real\n\n\n\n- 5 -\n\ntime is probably taken waiting for the user’s terminal to display the characters, or even for the user to read\nthem.\n\nSeparate programs are not always better than wider options; which is better depends on the problem.\nWhenever one needs a way to perform a new function, one faces the choice of whether to add a new option\nor write a new program (assuming that none of the programmable tools will do the job conveniently). The\nguiding principle for making the choice should be that each program does one thing. Options are appropri-\nately added to a program that already has the right functionality. If there is no such program, then a new\nprogram is called for. In that case, the usual criteria for program design should be used: the program should\nbe as general as possible, its default behavior should match the most common usage, and it should cooper-\nate with other programs.\n\nLet’s look at these issues in the context of another problem, dealing with fast terminal lines. The first\nversions of the UNIX system were written in the days when 150 baud was ‘‘fast,’’ and all terminals used\npaper. Today, 9600 baud is typical, and hard-copy terminals are rare. How should we deal with the fact\nthat output from programs like cat scrolls off the top of the screen faster than one can read it?\n\nThere are two obvious approaches. One is to tell each program about the properties of terminals, so it\ndoes the right thing (whether by option or automatically). The other is to write a command that handles ter-\nminals, and leave most programs untouched.\n\nAn example of the first approach is Berkeley’s version of the ls command, which lists the filenames\nin a directory. Let us call it lsc to avoid confusion. The 7th Edition ls command lists filenames in a sin-\ngle column, so for a large directory, the list of filenames disappears off the top of the screen at great speed.\nlsc prints in columns across the screen (which is assumed to be 80 columns wide), so there are typically\nfour to eight times as many names on each line, and thus the output usually fits on one screen. The option\n-1 can be used to get the old single-column behavior.\n\nSurprisingly, lsc operates differently if its output is a file or pipe:\n\nlsc\n\nproduces output different from\n\nlsc | cat\n\nThe reason is that lsc begins by examining whether or not its output is a terminal, and prints in columns\nonly if it is. By retaining single-column output to files or pipes, lsc ensures compatibility with programs\nlike grep or wc that expect things to be printed one per line. This ad hoc adjustment of the output format\ndepending on the destination is not only distasteful, it is unique � no standard UNIX command has this\nproperty.\n\nA more insidious problem with lsc is that the columnation facility, which is actually a useful, gen-\neral function, is built in and thus inaccessible to other programs that could use a similar compression. Pro-\ngrams should not attempt special solutions to general problems. The automatic columnation in lsc is rem-\niniscent of the ‘‘wild cards’’ found in some systems that provide filename pattern matching only for a par-\nticular program. The experience with centralized processing of wild cards in the UNIX shell shows over-\nwhelmingly how important it is to centralize the function where it can be used by all programs.\n\nOne solution for the ls problem is obvious � a separate program for columnation, so that columna-\ntion into say 5 columns is just\n\nls | 5\n\nIt is easy to build a first-draft version with the multi-column option of pr. The commands 2, 3, etc., are all\nlinks to a single file:\n\npr -$0 -t -l1 $*\n\n$0 is the program name (2, 3, etc.), so -$0 becomes -n where n is the number of columns that pr is to\nproduce. The other options suppress the normal heading, set the page length to 1 line, and pass the argu-\nments on to pr. This implementation is typical of the use of tools � it takes only a moment to write, and it\nserves perfectly well for most applications. If a more general service is desired, such as automatically\nselecting the number of columns for optimal compaction, a C program is probably required, but the one-\n\n\n\n- 6 -\n\nline implementation above satisfies the immediate need and provides a base for experimentation with the\ndesign of a fancier program, should one become necessary.\n\nSimilar reasoning suggests a solution for the general problem of data flowing off screens (colum-\nnated or not): a separate program to take any input and print it a screen at a time. Such programs are by\nnow widely available, under names like pg and more. This solution affects no other programs, but can be\nused with all of them. As usual, once the basic feature is right, the program can be enhanced with options\nfor specifying screen size, backing up, searching for patterns, and anything else that proves useful within\nthat basic job.\n\nThere is still a problem, of course. If the user forgets to pipe output into pg, the output that goes off\nthe top of the screen is gone. It would be desirable if the facilities of pg were always present without hav-\ning to be requested explicitly.\n\nThere are related useful functions that are typically only available as part of a particular program, not\nin a central service. One example is the history mechanism provided by some versions of the UNIX shell:\ncommands are remembered, so it’s possible to review and repeat them, perhaps with editing. But why\nshould this facility be restricted to the shell? (It’s not even general enough to pass input to programs called\nby the shell; it applies to shell commands only.) Certainly other programs could profit as well; any interac-\ntive program could benefit from the ability to re-execute commands. More subtly, why should the facility\nbe restricted to program input? Pipes have shown that the output from one program is often useful as input\nto another. With a little editing, the output of commands such as ls or make can be turned into commands\nor data for other programs.\n\nAnother facility that could be usefully centralized is typified by the editor escape in some mail com-\nmands. It is possible to pick up part of a mail message, edit it, and then include it in a reply. But this is all\ndone by special facilities within the mail command and so its use is restricted.\n\nEach such service is provided by a different program, which usually has its own syntax and seman-\ntics. This is in contrast to features such as pagination, which is always the same because it is only done by\none program. The editing of input and output text is more environmental than functional; it is more like the\nshell’s expansion of filename metacharacters than automatic numbering of lines of text. But since the shell\ndoes not see the characters sent as input to the programs, it cannot provide such editing. The emacs edi-\ntor3 provides a limited form of this capability, by processing all UNIX command input and output, but this\nis expensive, clumsy, and subjects the users to the complexities and vagaries of yet another massive subsys-\ntem (which isn’t to criticize the inventiveness of the idea).\n\nA potentially simpler solution is to let the terminal or terminal interface do the work, with controlled\nscrolling, editing and retransmission of visible text, and review of what has gone before. We have used the\nprogrammability of the Blit terminal4 � a programmable bitmap graphics display � to capitalize on this\npossibility, to good effect.\n\nThe Blit uses a mouse to point to characters on the display, which can be edited, rearranged and\ntransmitted back to the UNIX system as though they had been typed on the keyboard. Because the terminal\nis essentially simulating typed input, the programs are oblivious to how the text was created; all the features\ndiscussed above are provided by the general editing capabilities of the terminal, with no changes to the\nUNIX programs.\n\nThere are some obvious direct advantages to the Blit’s ability to process text under the user’s control.\nShell history is trivial: commands can be selected with the mouse, edited if desired, and retransmitted.\nSince from the terminal’s viewpoint all text on the display is equivalent, history is limited neither to the\nshell nor to command input. Because the Blit provides editing, most of the interactive features of programs\nlike mail are unnecessary; they are done easily, transparently and uniformly by the terminal.\n\nThe most interesting facet of this work, however, is the way it removes the need for interactive fea-\ntures in programs; instead, the Blit is the place where interaction is provided, much as the shell is the pro-\ngram that interprets filename-matching metacharacters. Unfortunately, of course, programming the termi-\nnal demands access to a part of the environment off-limits to most programmers, but the solution meshes\nwell with the environment and is appealing in its simplicity. If the terminal cannot be modified to provide\nthe capabilities, a user-level program or perhaps the UNIX kernel itself could be modified fairly easily to do\nroughly what the Blit does, with similar results.\n\n\n\n- 7 -\n\nThe key to problem-solving on the UNIX system is to identify the right primitive operations and to\nput them at the right place. UNIX programs tend to solve general problems rather than special cases. In a\nvery loose sense, the programs are orthogonal, spanning the space of jobs to be done (although with a fair\namount of overlap for reasons of history, convenience or efficiency). Functions are placed where they will\ndo the most good: there shouldn’t be a pager in every program that produces output any more than there\nshould be filename pattern matching in every program that uses filenames.\n\nOne thing that UNIX does not need is more features. It is successful in part because it has a small\nnumber of good ideas that work well together. Merely adding features does not make it easier for users to\ndo things � it just makes the manual thicker. The right solution in the right place is always more effective\nthan haphazard hacking.\n\n1. B. W. Kernighan and Rob Pike, The UNIX Programming Environment, Prentice-Hall (1984).\n\n2. D.

The\ninvention of new facilities in computing systems can be guided by these principles. For\nexample, the introduction of networking need not require any change to the majority of\nsystem utilities, because objects such as files on remote machines can be given syntacti-\ncally familiar names within the local machine’s name space. Indeed, the implementers of\nnetworks often do well by these standards by striving to make remote files essentially\nindistinguishable from local ones. Unfortunately, the situation with internetwork mail\naddresses is not as satisfactory. The practitioners of internetworking would profit by\nunderstanding the benefits of simple, uniform syntax.\n\nresearch!ucbvax!@cmu-cs-pt.arpa:@CMU-ITC-LINUS:dave%CMU-ITC-LINUS@CMU-CS-PT\n\n- Carnegie-Mellon University mailer\n\nI cannot tell what the dickens his name is.\n- Shakespeare, Merry Wives of Windsor, II. ii. 20.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAny object relevant to computation — file, process, user, computer, network or whatever — needs a\nname. The name determines the access: it is by interpreting the name, within the name space it inhabits,\nthat a program or person is given access to the object. The manner in which names are constructed affects\nnot only how objects are named but also how they are used.\n\nThe form of names and name spaces is the subject of this essay. We will use file names from several\noperating systems as examples to illustrate criteria for distinguishing good names from bad. The same cri-\nteria may be applied to network mail names, pointing out some of the shortcomings of the current ad hoc\nsystems for internetworking.\n\nThe criteria are not new, and seem to be generally accepted, but are not applied in practice. This\npaper is an attempt to re-establish their use.\n\nPrinciples of Names and Name Spaces\n\nWhat’s in a name? A string of characters, encoded by some convention (ASCII or EBCDIC), that\nidentifies an object. If the function of a name stopped there, this definition would be sufficient. In IBM’s\nMVS, for example, a file name is an at most 44-character string, largely uninterpreted by system software.\nThe name space is ‘flat,‘ or linear.\n\nSystems designed more recently use names to help organize as well as identify. For instance,\nalthough in MVS the disk containing the file is specified separately from the name, in MS-DOS part of the\n__________________\n† An earlier version of this appeared in Summer 1985 Usenix Conference Proceedings, Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\n\n\n- 2 -\n\nname of a file is a string that identifies the disk drive holding the file. Syntax separates these components\nof the name; MS-DOS uses a colon following the disk name, a single character:\n\nA:FILE\n\nis a file on disk drive A, while\n\nB:FILE\n\nis a file on disk drive B.\n\nThe advantage of putting such information in names is that software need not know about disks to\nmanipulate files. Internally, of course, system software must use the syntax of the name to locate the file,\nbut this is largely transparent to applications software, and users.\n\nThe MVS system uses independent information (stored in a catalog) to find a file given its name,\nwhile MS-DOS exposes location information in the name. MS-DOS users may put related files on the\nsame disk, thus using a distinguished piece of the name to help organize their world. MVS users must\ninstead adapt ad hoc strategies (conventions for the syntax of names) to the same end. Thus each system\ndoes both more and less for the user: MVS provides no help in organization and a naming independent of\nthe physical location of the file, while MS-DOS provides the opposite. Instead, if names had multiple\ncomponents (that is, syntax), where the components did not necessarily correspond to physical devices, the\nname space would have the advantages of that of both MVS and MS-DOS, with the disadvantages of\nneither. Such a name space exists.\n\nA good example: UNIX®\n\nUNIX file name space is a tree, with file names that specify a path from one node to another. The\nrepresentation of the name is a simple ASCII string, with slashes / separating node identifiers. The name\n\n/usr/rob/bin/cat-v\n\nis a path from the root of the tree (denoted by the leading slash), through nodes called usr, rob and bin,\nto a file called cat-v. Nodes intermediate in the tree are called directories. The system uses the compo-\nnents to find the file, which the user can use as syntax to organize sets of files. For example, although on\nmost UNIX systems, the string /usr specifies a separate disk drive, this is irrelevant to both software and\nusers; it is merely a string that identifies the directory beneath which users’ files may be found.\n\nThe structure of the name space (a directory tree) is reflected in the style of the name (a path through\nthe tree). Were the file system arranged differently, say as a flat array, the form and interpretation of file\nnames would also be different; for example, UNIX processes are named by small integers.\n\nProperties of Name Spaces\n\nName spaces have some general properties. First, names within the space may be absolute or rela-\ntive. Absolute names specify an object by position with respect to a single fixed point, such as the root of\nthe UNIX file system (named /); relative names, with respect to a local point (the ‘current working direc-\ntory’ in UNIX, named . (dot)). Also, an operating system typically has operators to manipulate its name\nspace, such as system calls to create and remove files. UNIX also provides a system call (named mount) to\njoin together two name spaces by attaching the root of one space, resident on a separate disk drive, to a leaf\nof another.\n\nFinally, a name space has syntax — how a name is constructed — and semantics — the nature of the\nobject a name identifies.\n\nA UNIX file name, for example, is a sequence of slash-separated strings that identifies a formatless\nbyte stream. External conventions may provide further semantics: the UNIX file system contains objects\nthat are not ordinary files. Simply by having ordinary file names, though, these objects have ordinary file\nproperties such as protection. Some examples from our research version of UNIX, called the Ninth Edition:\n\nDevice files. With names conventionally prefixed (that is, residing in the directory) /dev, these files pro-\nvide direct access to devices. The name /dev/mt, for example, identifies a magnetic tape drive.\n\nProcesses. The directory /proc contains files with names that are process numbers. Opening such a file\n\n\n\n- 3 -\n\nprovides access to processes for purposes such as interactive debugging. Although processes have\nintegers that identify them, it is convenient to provide names for them in the file system as well. For\nexample, listing the directory containing the process files is a simple way to identify running pro-\ncesses.\n\nDatabases. Some databases are conveniently represented as name-value pairs in a hierarchy, and such data-\nbases may be mapped into the file system name space. For example, the directory /n/face con-\ntains a hierarchically-structured database that associates digitized images of people’s faces with the\npeople’s electronic mail addresses.\n\nOther files. UNIX has the notion of standard input: the input connected to a (typically) interactive program.\nThe name /dev/stdin identifies a file that, when opened, connects to the standard input of the\nprogram. This allows files that demand a file name (such as the file comparison program) to be given\ninput directly from the interactive terminal or from a pipe.\n\nBecause these unusual objects have regular names, existing tools can treat them as files, so standard soft-\nware can provide services for them that would otherwise require special handling.\n\nSome of the Ninth Edition examples above have different names in other UNIX systems.\n/dev/stdin is often represented by the single character -, as an argument to commands, but this con-\nvention is capriciously followed. Because it must be provided explicitly by each program, it is only avail-\nable in some programs. By providing /dev/stdin in the global name space, it is available uniformly for\nall programs, always. As another example, processes are represented by an integer process identifier, which\nis only meaningful to a few process-specific system calls. These calls implement their own protection\nmechanism, although the protection provided by the file system suits perfectly (these system calls predate\nthe process file system). Finally, virtual terminals implemented using the multiplexed files of the Seventh\nEdition (an earlier research version of the system) have no external name, so it is impossible to open one for\nI/O. The Ninth Edition provides a name in the file system that is available, without prearrangement or spe-\ncial protocol, to any program.\n\nConnecting Name Spaces\n\nWhen machines are connected together, their name spaces may be joined to facilitate the sharing of\nfiles. If the name spaces have the same clean structure, that structure can be extended simply to describe\nthe larger space. The Newcastle Connection names a file on another machine, say ucbvax, as\n/../ucbvax/usr/rob/bin/cat-v; the Ninth Edition notation is\n/n/ucbvax/usr/rob/bin/cat-v. In the former the name space has been extended by making it a\nsubspace of a larger space, in the latter a new name subspace has been grafted on using mount, but in nei-\nther case has the syntax of names been changed; any program that understands a file name will understand a\nnetwork file name without change, and relative names for files (those that don’t begin with /) are\nunchanged. As a spectacular example, we might see on which machines user wnj has a login by searching\n(using a program called grep) through the system administration files (called /etc/passwd) on all the\nmachines:\n\ngrep wnj /n/*/etc/passwd\n\nThe file name ‘wild card’ character * matches all files within a directory. Here, it happens to match all\nmachines reachable from the local machine, although grep is oblivious of this distinction. We could even\ninvestigate those machines connected to ucbvax by\n\ngrep wnj /n/ucbvax/n/*/etc/passwd\n\nThe file system that is the union of these name spaces might have no global root, so the meaning of\nan absolute name may become ambiguous because of the presence of multiple reference points. In fact,\nthere might be no single point to which all names can be fixed. In practice, though, this ambiguity is unim-\nportant.\n\n\n\n- 4 -\n\nA bad example: VAX/VMS\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone chooses naming conventions in accord with these guidelines. On\nVAX/VMS our canonical file might be called UCBVAX::SYS$DISK:[ROB.BIN]CAT_V.EXE;13.\nThe VMS file naming scheme provides a distinct syntax for each level in the name: UCBVAX:: is a\nmachine; SYS$DISK: is a disk (actually a macro that expands to a disk name such as DUA0:);\n[ROB.BIN] is a directory; CAT_V is a file ‘base’ name; .EXE is a file ‘type’; and ;13 is a version num-\nber.\n\nAlthough this syntax may seem unnecessarily cumbersome, it has a precedent: it is analogous to\nexpressions in programming languages. Consider a C expression such as\n*structure[index].field->ptr. If * were postfix and / the only dereferencing operator, the\nexpression might be written structure/index/field/ptr/. Functionally-minded programmers\nmight use the notation contents(ptr(field(index(structure)))). (A single character can-\nnot be used in C because it could not distinguish X[Y] and X->Y, with X a structure pointer and Y an inte-\nger or structure element respectively, but this ambiguity could be eliminated in a different language.) C and\nVMS use syntax to distinguish the types of the components of a name. Instead, the UNIX file system delib-\nerately hides the distinctions. Aside from the obvious advantages such as simplicity of syntax and the\nusurping of only a single character, the uniformity also makes the name space easier to manipulate: the\nmount system call aliases a disk and a directory.\n\nVMS has no true name space manipulation operator. Although one could be constructed, it would be\nlimited in scope: how could a disk be mounted atop SYS$DISK:[ROB.BIN] when disks are always\nbefore directories in the name? Instead, VMS has macros such as SYS$DISK to hide the manner in which\nthe space is assembled, and even to provide the concept of a local name by automatically inserting an\nexpanded macro before an unqualified name.\n\nThe problems with dynamic evaluation of macros are well known. For example, the VMS service to\nset the reference point for local names (the equivalent of UNIX chdir) sets the default prefix for file\nnames, but the prefix will only be evaluated and so checked for validity, when a file name is interpreted,\nwhich may be arbitrarily and confusingly long after the prefix was set. In fact, the default prefix macro is\nhandled in a special way, because directories are not constructed by simple concatenation; subdirectory\n[.BIN] in directory [ROB] is named [ROB.BIN]. Also, these local names are not really local at all; the\nprefix implicitly binds them to a root of the name space. This implies that all names are always attached to\nsome root, and therefore if the root changes, the name must also change, invisibly.\n\nAnother problem with VMS names is that one cannot do the equivalent of searching the VMS pass-\nword files (SYSUAF.LIS) on various machines with *::SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAF.LIS; the * operator\ndoesn’t apply to that portion of a name. This is an example of the general problem that whenever the name\nsyntax is changed all programs that interpret names must be modified. More subtly, although if the\nmachine ucbvax were a gateway we could access files on a distant machine as\nUCBVAX::KREMVAX::file, it is only because the semantics of :: explicitly permit such access. The\n:: operator is implemented by passing the string after it to the remote machine, but first checking its syn-\ntax, so the file name parser must have special code for multiple ::’s.\n\nA Quibble about Cedar\n\nThe Cedar file system has a uniform naming syntax, just like UNIX, except that files have version\nnumbers, separated from the file name by an exclamation mark !. The implementers thought that version\nnumbers are fundamentally different components of file names and therefore deserved different syntax. But\nthe change in syntax requires new rules to define the meaning of file names. A good test of naming\nschemes is whether arbitrary names constructed by the syntactic rules make sense within the rules of the\nsystem or whether their interpretation requires new semantic rules. In Cedar file,\n/usr/rob/bin/cat-v!3 is clearly version 3 of cat-v, but what is /usr/rob!3/bin/cat-v?\n\n\n\n- 5 -\n\nConnecting to other machine’s file systems\n\nThe IBIS remote file system on UNIX 4.2BSD names a remote file as ucbvax:file. Many pro-\ngrams don’t understand this syntax; the shell (command interpreter) must be modified to make *:file\nbehave as we expect, because the shell expects a slash to separate name components. Worse, by changing\nthe syntax, the implicit semantics of the original naming scheme is lost. In the Ninth Edition name\n/n/ucbvax/file it is obvious what file refers to: a file in the root directory of ucbvax. But what\nis it in ucbvax:file? It might be a file in the root, but it isn’t. It is a file in the initial working directory\non the destination machine (ucbvax) of the user invoking the name on the source machine (unless it\nbegins with /); its meaning depends on who is asking. The extra semantics of : complicate attempts to\npatch the syntactic problems. We might try creating a connection (called a symbolic link in UNIX) from the\nname /n/ucbvax to the name ucbvax:, but /n/ucbvax/file would then still point to a file in\nsomeone’s home directory, and /n/ucbvax/usr/wnj/file would refer to\n/usr/wnj/usr/wnj/file. If the link evaluates to ucbvax:/, things work as expected, but the\nslash-less form of IBIS naming is made unavailable.\n\nPart of the problem in the IBIS file system is that it is implemented outside the name space. By using\na variant of the standard system call mount, the Ninth Edition remote file system guarantees that the syn-\ntax and semantics of names are free of surprises. For example, it is clear what\n/n/ucbvax/n/kremvax/file refers to, but what about the IBIS name ucbvax:kremvax:file?\nWhere does kremvax:file get interpreted?\n\nThere are other ways to interpret file names like ucbvax:file. When using the UNIX program\nuucp to copy a local file to a remote machine, the name ucbvax!file refers to the file on ucbvax\nwhose name is file prefixed by the current directory on the source machine. The prize goes to DECNET,\nhowever: ucbvax::file refers to file in the home directory of the ‘default network user’ on the desti-\nnation machine, and ucbvax\"wnj password\"::file refers to file in wnj’s home directory. It is\ninexcusable that the password is in the file name, let alone that it is in clear text.\n\nThe story so far\n\nIn summary, there are some guidelines for constructing naming conventions, particularly for objects\nin a network. There should be both relative names and absolute names. Relative names are more important\nbecause, among other reasons, the root of the name space may be unknown or non-unique. The syntax\nshould be clean and uniform; every new syntactic rule requires at least one, and usually many, semantic\nrules to resolve peculiarities introduced by the new syntax. If the name space is a tree or any other kind of\ngraph, a single character should be used to separate nodes in a name.\n\nIf these guidelines are followed, names of objects in a network of machines will be easy to construct\nand interpret; difficult problems of networking will be completely hidden to the users and programs access-\ning objects in the network. If they are ignored, both users and programs must be aware of and understand\nthe details of naming locally, globally and everywhere in between.\n\nPrinciples of mail names\n\nNow consider the other common name space, mail names. Mail names are more complex than file\nnames, for both syntactic and semantic reasons. There are conflicting syntactic traditions, the most familiar\ntwo being the UNIX tradition and the ARPANET tradition. Also, mail names are interpreted by user pro-\ngrams only, with no operating system to enforce semantics. Thus, the interpretation of the name space is\nsubject to arbitrary hackery.\n\nEven a trivial case like the name pjw in the command\n\nmail pjw\n\nhas no clear meaning. When electronic mail was invented, the name pjw referred to a mailbox on the local\nmachine — the only machine to which mail could be sent. The local space of mailbox names was a small\nflat space. Later, when systems were connected together, there were two ways to generalize. If the com-\nputers were closely connected (that is, sharing administration), one could extend the flat name space over\nthe whole set of machines, so that saying mail pjw on any of the machines gets pjw’s mailbox on pjw’s\n\n\n\n- 6 -\n\nhome machine. If the machines were instead loosely connected, a more attractive scheme would be to use\nmachine names to qualify the local mailbox names: pjw@system in the ARPANET tradition, or\nsystem!pjw in the UNIX tradition. The two methods differ only in the naming and how the software\ndecides to find the destination. In the first alternative, it looks up pjw in a database, while in the second it\nlooks up system. In both cases, the software on the machines involved must also have a protocol for\ndelivering mail, but that’s irrelevant here. Note that neither naming scheme has anything to do with routing\nthe message.\n\nAt this level, either of these two schemes is fairly convenient. But when we try to connect lots of\nsystems with these flat name spaces, names must either conflict or be decorated artificially to disambiguate\nthem. We should apply the principles of good naming to find a better solution.\n\nMail names specify paths within a large name space populated by systems and mailboxes rather than\nfiles, but the basic idea is the same. The question is what a path denotes. The answer depends on how the\nsoftware determines what to do with the mail.\n\nImagine we are on machine ucbvax and want to send mail to pjw@system. There are two meth-\nods to negotiate the transaction. The first method, used by UNIX, views system as the name of an author-\nity that the mail and mail address are passed to. That is, sending the mail involves a message to system of\nthe form, ‘‘I am machine ucbvax, here is mail for pjw.’’ The second, that of the ARPANET, interprets\nsystem as the name of an authority that will say where to send the mail, as in, ‘‘I am machine ucbvax,\nwhere do I send mail for pjw?’’ The destination of these messages is found by looking up system in a\ndatabase. (The details of sending the message are outside this discussion.) All naming schemes for mail\nfollow some combination of these alternatives. The UNIX method uses the same mechanism to resolve\nnames and to transmit mail; the ARPANET method resolves the names with one mechanism and uses some\nother, not associated with the name at all, to send the mail.\n\nGiven these two models, how do we generalize mail delivery in larger networks? For ARPANET, a\nmail address user@world3.world2.world1 is interpreted by looking up world1 and then asking it\nwhere to send mail for world3.world2. For UNIX, a mail address world1!world2!world3!user\nis interpreted by looking up world1 and then sending the mail and world2!world3!user to it.\nAlthough the two forms sound similar, they have different problems. (And, why does ARPA use two char-\nacters when one is sufficient?)\n\nThe most common interpretation of the UNIX name is as a route, but it need have nothing to do with\na route. Once the name is handed off to world1, it can be rewritten to correspond to the syntax of\nworld1’s name space; in fact, UNIX mailers rewrite names freely. Because ARPANET names are han-\ndled differently, they cannot be rewritten: the answer to the routing question must produce the four-byte\nbinary network address of the destination mailbox. (At least in principle, this defect may be circumvented.\nThe response to the routing question might be a little program: ‘‘Send the mail to A and tell it to use proto-\ncol P to send it to B’’ and so forth. However, that’s not how it’s done in practice.)\n\nConsider again the relation between mail names and file names. When the operating system inter-\nprets the name /n/ucbvax/n/kremvax/file it discovers that the directory /n/ucbvax refers to a\nremote machine, finds the server on that machine, and sends it the name /n/kremvax/file expecting\nback a handle to use the file. It does not care what the server does with the name. It does not expect to get\nback instructions for finding the file. It is asking for file service, not name service. Indeed were ucbvax a\nVMS machine, the server might invisibly translate /n/kremvax/file immediately into\nKREMVAX::SYS$DISK:[NETUSER]file to discover it on its local system. Remote file access would\nbe harder to implement using the ARPANET scheme.\n\nName servers† considered speculative\n\nName servers don’t scale well, for precisely the reason that the ARPANET name scheme doesn’t scale\nwell: the name server must understand all possible name syntaxes. When a system with a different naming\nconvention is connected, the name server must suddenly interpret all the different syntaxes, instead of\n__________________\n† ‘‘Name server’’ is a noun phrase that is ambiguous. You hand a name server a name, it hands you connection informa-\ntion. Thus it serves connections, not names. Consider the difference between air pollution and noise pollution.\n\n\n\n- 7 -\n\nleaving the job to the new system itself. Worse, how do you connect two networks, each with its own name\nserver? Even if the servers use the same data formats and algorithms, they might use unique identifiers that\nbecome non-unique when they are joined.\n\nName servers have problems on other levels, too. Who administers a name server’s database? If the\ndatabase is not audited frequently much of the data will be obsolete, while if the controls are too onerous,\npeople won’t bother keeping the database current. What does the database contain? Most name servers\nproduce network addresses, but no single network reaches everywhere.\n\nWhy are mail names such a mess?\n\nBecause people keep gluing name spaces together without smoothing the syntactic differences. The\nresult is the mail name equivalent of bastardized file names like\n/n/ucbvax/UCBVAX::KREMVAX:/rob/bin/A:dos-file where different conventions are mixed\nin a single string.\n\nRelative names are important\n\nThe ARPANET people define their names to have the form\n\nlocal-part@domain\n\nwhere both local-part and domain are dot-separated lists of words. Domains are the generalization of what\nwe have been calling systems; the local part is anything understood by the leftmost domain name. Accord-\ning to RFC 882 (‘‘Domain Names – Concepts and Facilities’’), the domains are all absolute. The dot signi-\nfying the root of the hierarchy is implicit at the right of the list of names, which makes it impossible to con-\nnect disjoint name spaces since all interpreters of names must know all names at the top level of the hierar-\nchy. Also, for backwards compatibility, RFC 822 (‘‘Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Mes-\nsages’’) allows all but the leftmost of the domain names to be elided, since ‘‘specification of a fully quali-\nfied address can become inconvenient.’’\n\nWhat happens in practice?\n\nAs long as software continues to deliver mail, people are unwilling to improve the state of affairs.\nMailers just butt together names with their own rewriting rules, producing names like:\n\nIJQ3SRA%UCLAMVS.BITNET%SU-LINDY@SU-CSLI.ARPA\n\nThis is the name of user IJQ3SRA on machine UCLAMVS, accessible through BITNET from machine\nSU-LINDY, which is known to SU-CSLI on the ARPANET. Each program that touched this name\nrewrote it by its own rules, although the domains proposal is intended to prevent this.\n\nThere are two domains in this name (although the syntax is wrong): BITNET and ARPA. However,\nBITNET is not a registered name, so the gateway service between BITNET and ARPANET must be made\nexplicit in the name, requiring the invention of a new syntax character (%) which is translated to @ at the\ngateway, because ARPANET names can only contain a single @. Despite the words in the standard about\nhierarchy, the domain space is nearly flat, so the local parts of the names carry source routing and domain\ntransitions explicitly. To worsen matters, machines that advertise adherence to the standard in fact do not;\ninstead the name translations that occur at gateways (such as converting @ to % and rearranging the compo-\nnents) are at best ad hoc. By legislating away bad names, ARPANET has reduced the problem of\nnetworking to a still-unsolved problem. But the mailers plod resolutely on.\n\nStandards?\n\nIt is clear that standards are necessary for electronic mail to be delivered reliably across network\nboundaries. What needs to be standardized is the interpretation of names, especially at network boundaries.\nUntil such a standard exists; is syntactically and semantically clean; distributes the interpretation of names\nacross the systems that understand them; and is adhered to, the network mail situation will not improve.\n\n\n\n- 8 -\n\nConclusions\n\nDoug McIlroy has observed that\n\n... bad notations can stifle progress. Roman numerals hobbled mathematics for a millennium but\nwere propagated by custom and by natural deference to authority. Today we no longer meekly accept\nindividual authority. Instead, we have ‘‘standards,’’ impersonal imprimaturs on convention. Some\nstandards are sound and indispensable; some simply celebrate bureaucratic littleness of mind. A har-\nvest of gimmicks to save appearances within the standard has grown up, then gimmicks to save the\nappearances within the appearances. You know how each one got there: an overnight hack to paste\nanother tumor onto a wild cancerous growth. The concern was with method, regardless of results.\nThe result is extravagantly worse than Roman numerals: you can’t read the notation right to left or\nleft to right. As an amalgam of languages, it can’t be deciphered by a native speaker of any one of\nthem, much as if we were to switch at random places in a number between Roman and Arabic signs\nand between big-endian and little-endian order. But now that it all ‘‘works’’ — at least for the strong\nof stomach — the tumors themselves are being standardized.\n\nI fled, and cry’d out ‘‘Death’’;\nHell trembled at the hideous name, and sigh’d\nFrom all her caves, and back resounded, ‘‘Death.’’\n\n- Milton, Paradise Lost\n\n\n","extracted_metadata":{"pdf:producer":["GPL Ghostscript SVN PRE-RELEASE 8.61"],"pdf:hasXMP":["true"],"access_permission:modify_annotations":["true"],"pdf:totalUnmappedUnicodeChars":["0"],"access_permission:extract_for_accessibility":["true"],"access_permission:can_print":["true"],"X-TIKA:Parsed-By":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.pdf.PDFParser"],"access_permission:fill_in_form":["true"],"Content-Length":["32949"],"xmpMM:DocumentID":["b5b6260c-1643-11e8-0000-0e1a6b6e9242"],"pdf:overallPercentageUnmappedUnicodeChars":["0.0"],"X-TIKA:Parsed-By-Full-Set":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.pdf.PDFParser"],"access_permission:assemble_document":["true"],"access_permission:extract_content":["true"],"xmp:CreateDate":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"xmp:About":["b5b6260c-1643-11e8-0000-0e1a6b6e9242"],"dcterms:created":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"dc:format":["application/pdf; version=1.4"],"resourceName":["The Hideous Name - 1985 (pike85hideous).pdf"],"xmp:CreatorTool":["UnknownApplication"],"pdf:charsPerPage":["2579","3892","3845","4104","4169","4568","3613","1318"],"pdf:hasXFA":["false"],"pdf:num3DAnnotations":["0"],"xmpTPg:NPages":["8"],"pdf:containsDamagedFont":["false"],"pdf:encrypted":["false"],"Content-Type":["application/pdf"],"pdf:docinfo:producer":["GPL Ghostscript SVN PRE-RELEASE 8.61"],"pdf:containsNonEmbeddedFont":["true"],"pdf:docinfo:modified":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"access_permission:can_modify":["true"],"dcterms:modified":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"access_permission:can_print_degraded":["true"],"pdf:unmappedUnicodeCharsPerPage":["0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"],"dc:title":["Untitled"],"pdf:PDFVersion":["1.4"],"pdf:hasMarkedContent":["false"],"pdf:docinfo:created":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"xmp:ModifyDate":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"pdf:hasCollection":["false"]},"metadata_field_count":40,"attempts":1,"timestamp":1752386791.022609,"platform":"Linux","python_version":"3.13.5"},{"file_path":"test_documents/pdfs/fake-memo.pdf","file_size":13374,"file_type":"pdf","category":"tiny","framework":"extractous","iteration":1,"extraction_time":0.05052590370178223,"startup_time":null,"peak_memory_mb":629.53515625,"avg_memory_mb":629.31015625,"peak_cpu_percent":58.6,"avg_cpu_percent":11.72,"total_io_mb":null,"status":"success","character_count":215,"word_count":37,"error_type":null,"error_message":null,"quality_metrics":{"char_count":215,"word_count":37,"sentence_count":3,"paragraph_count":5,"avg_word_length":4.45945945945946,"avg_sentence_length":12.333333333333334,"extraction_completeness":1.0,"text_coherence":1.0,"noise_ratio":0.0,"gibberish_ratio":0.07407407407407407,"flesch_reading_ease":77.70585585585587,"gunning_fog_index":6.014414414414415,"has_proper_formatting":true,"maintains_line_breaks":true,"preserves_whitespace":false,"table_structure_preserved":false,"format_specific_score":1.0,"expected_content_preserved":false,"has_encoding_issues":false,"has_ocr_artifacts":false,"preserves_pdf_formatting":true},"overall_quality_score":0.72213231981982,"extracted_text":"\nMay 5, 2023\n\n\nTo Whom it May Concern:\n\n\nThere were 20,000 bottles of water, 10,000 blankets, and 200 laptops delivered on January 23, \n2023.

 7         7 reject\n\nu-->2              8         8 reject\n\nu-->3              9         0 reject\n\nu-->4             10         1 ok\n\nSo, if we define g() as determined above, then h() will be a minimal perfect hash \nfunction on the given set of words.\n\nThe primary difficulty is the cost, because the search phase can degenerate to \nexponential performance, and so it is only practical for small sets of words.\n\n\n","extracted_metadata":{"xmpMM:DocumentID":["uuid:85fa5c25-f8c5-48b4-a50b-61e39da126f2"],"xmp:ModifyDate":["2009-11-10T17:17:41Z"],"pdf:hasCollection":["false"],"X-TIKA:Parsed-By-Full-Set":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.pdf.PDFParser"],"access_permission:assemble_document":["true"],"access_permission:extract_for_accessibility":["true"],"xmpTPg:NPages":["5"],"access_permission:can_print":["true"],"pdf:hasXFA":["false"],"pdf:totalUnmappedUnicodeChars":["0"],"access_permission:can_modify":["true"],"pdf:docinfo:created":["2009-11-10T17:17:41Z"],"pdf:containsDamagedFont":["false"],"dcterms:created":["2009-11-10T17:17:41Z"],"pdf:encrypted":["false"],"access_permission:modify_annotations":["true"],"access_permission:fill_in_form":["true"],"pdf:docinfo:creator":["William

years](/wiki/Light_year \"Light year\") (700 [pc](/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\")) from [Earth](/wiki/Earth \"Earth\") in the constellation [Fornax](/wiki/Fornax \"Fornax\").\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\")\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6 \"#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6\") The star is part of the [Helmi stream](/wiki/Helmi_stream \"Helmi stream\"), a former [dwarf galaxy](/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy \"Dwarf galaxy\") that merged with the [Milky Way](/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") between six and nine billion years ago.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") As a result, HIP 13044 circles the [Galactic Center](/wiki/Galactic_Center \"Galactic Center\") at a highly irregular orbit with respect to the [galactic plane](/wiki/Galactic_plane \"Galactic plane\"). HIP 13044 is slightly less massive than the Sun, but is approximately seven times its size. The star, which is estimated to be at least nine billion years old, has passed the [red-giant](/wiki/Red_giant \"Red giant\") phase. The relatively fast rotation of the star may be due to having engulfed one or more planets during the red-giant phase.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")\n\n## Observational history\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Observational history\")\\]\nA science team from the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](/wiki/Max_Planck_Institute_for_Astronomy \"Max Planck Institute for Astronomy\") first observed HIP 13044 using [Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph](/w/index.php?title=Fiber-fed_Extended_Range_Optical_Spectrograph&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (page does not exist)\") (FEROS) at the [European Southern Observatory](/wiki/European_Southern_Observatory \"European Southern Observatory\")'s [La Silla Observatory](/wiki/La_Silla_Observatory \"La Silla Observatory\") in Chile. The first follow-up led to the collection of 36 [radial velocity](/wiki/Radial_velocity \"Radial velocity\") measurements taken between September 2009 and July 2010.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")\n\nThe team also used [photometric](</wiki/Photometry_(astronomy)> \"Photometry (astronomy)\") data that had been passively collected by and publicly released into the archive of the [SuperWASP](/wiki/SuperWASP \"SuperWASP\") collaboration, which had been observing the region where the star was located. In this data, HIP 13044 was found to oscillate; the signal was blocked roughly every sixteen days. Analysis of the SuperWASP and FEROS data led to the supposed discovery of the planet *HIP 13044 b*,\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") although this claim was later refuted.\n\n## Characteristics\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Characteristics\")\\]\nHIP 13044 is an [F-type](/wiki/Stellar_classification#Class_F \"Stellar classification\") star located approximately 701 [parsecs](/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\") (2,286 [light years](/wiki/Light_year \"Light year\")) from Earth in the [Helmi stream](/wiki/Helmi_stream \"Helmi stream\")\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")—a group of low-metallicity stars moving with large velocities relative to the Sun. The star follows an eccentric galactic orbit, with a distance from the galactic center ranging from 7 to 16 [kiloparsecs](/wiki/Kiloparsec \"Kiloparsec\").\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\") The orbit does not lie in the [galactic plane](/wiki/Galactic_plane \"Galactic plane\"), and can reach distances as high as 13 kpc above it. This indicates that it once was part of a satellite galaxy of the [Milky Way](/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") that was disrupted 6–9 billion years ago.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") The star itself is estimated to be at least nine billion years old.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\")\n\nHIP 13044 is fairly evolved star [fusing helium](/wiki/Triple-alpha_process \"Triple-alpha process\") in its core, and has therefore already passed the [red-giant](/wiki/Red_giant \"Red giant\") phase of its evolution.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") It lies near the blue end of the red horizontal branch bordering the [instability strip](/wiki/Instability_strip \"Instability strip\").\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") Its surface temperature is about 6025 K and its radius is approximately 6.7 [solar radii](/wiki/Solar_radius \"Solar radius\"). HIP 13044's mass is estimated to be 0.8 [solar masses](/wiki/Solar_mass \"Solar mass\").\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\") Having a rotation period of 5–6 days, HIP 13044 is a fast-rotating star for its type. It is possible that this is because it has swallowed planets during its red-giant phase.\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6 \"#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6\")\n\nHIP 13044 has an [apparent magnitude](/wiki/Apparent_magnitude \"Apparent magnitude\") of 9.94 and cannot be seen with the unaided eye.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\")\n\n## Claims of a planetary system\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Claims of a planetary system\")\\]\nIn 2010, it was announced that a giant planet in a 16.2-day orbit had been discovered by the radial velocity measurements. This would have had implications for planet formation in metal-poor systems and survival of planets being engulfed by expanded giant stars.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") Subsequent analysis of the data revealed problems with the detection: for example an erroneous barycentric correction had been applied (the same error had also led to claims of planets around [HIP 11952](/wiki/HIP_11952 \"HIP 11952\") that were subsequently refuted). After applying the corrections, there is no evidence for a planet orbiting the star.\\[[9]\\](#cite_note-JonesJenkins2014-9 \"#cite_note-JonesJenkins2014-9\")\n\n## References\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: References\")\\]\n\n1. ^ [***a***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-0 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-0\") [***b***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-1 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-1\") [***c***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-2 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-2\") [***d***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-3 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-3\") [***e***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-4 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-4\") [***f***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-5 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-5\") [Brown, A.

In the verse charm, Sinthgunt is referred to as the sister of the personified sun, [Sunna](</wiki/S%C3%B3l_(Germanic_mythology)> \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\") (whose name is [alliterative](/wiki/Alliterative_verse \"Alliterative verse\") to *Sinthgunt*),\\[[1]\\](#cite_note-ORCHARD112-1 \"#cite_note-ORCHARD112-1\") and the two sisters are cited as both producing incantations to heal the horse of [Phol](/wiki/Phol \"Phol\"), another otherwise unattested figure but possibly the same as [Balder](/wiki/Baldr \"Baldr\"), who is named elsewhere in the charm. The two are then followed by [Friia](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") and [Uolla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\"), also alliterative and stated as sisters.\n\nAs Sinthgunt is otherwise unattested, her significance is otherwise unknown, but some scholarly theories exist about her role in Germanic mythology based on proposed etymologies and the potential significance of her placement within the poem.\n\n## Etymology\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Etymology\")\\]\nThe etymology of *Sinthgunt* is unclear. In the original manuscript, *Sinthgunt* is spelled *Sin**ht**gunt* (emphasis added). In the 19th century, [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\") stuck strictly to this reading, proposing a complex compound based on Germanic *\\*Sin-naχt-gund*, i.e., \"the night-walking one\".\\[[2]\\](#cite_note-2 \"#cite_note-2\") As a result of the pairing with Sunna, the personified sun (corresponding to Old Norse [Sól](</wiki/S%C3%B3l_(Germanic_mythology)> \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\")), this etymology has been interpreted as a reference to the [moon](/wiki/Moon \"Moon\"). However, this reading has yielded problems; the moon in Germanic mythology is considered masculine, exemplified in the personification of the moon in [Norse mythology](/wiki/Norse_mythology \"Norse mythology\"), [Máni](/wiki/M%C3%A1ni \"Máni\"), a male figure. According to [Rudolf Simek](/wiki/Rudolf_Simek \"Rudolf Simek\"), the historical record lacks evidence for any cult of personified celestial bodies among the ancient Germanic peoples.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-3 \"#cite_note-3\")\n\nStefan Schaffner rejects this etymology, as does [Heiner Eichner](/w/index.php?title=Heiner_Eichner&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Heiner Eichner (page does not exist)\") \\[[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiner_Eichner \"de:Heiner Eichner\")\\], because the first element *Sinht-* cannot be based on the presupposed earlier Germanic *\\*sinχt-*. Such a Germanic form would have yielded Old High German *\\*sīht* by regular sound change.\\[[4]\\](#cite_note-4 \"#cite_note-4\") The amended *Sinthgunt* presupposes a Proto-Germanic compound *\\*Senþa-gunþjō*, the first element meaning \"raid, (military) campaign\", the second one \"fight\". This interpretation corresponds well to other Old High German female names such as *Sindhilt* (from *\\*Senþa-χilðijō*, with its second element also meaning \"fight\", cf. [Old Norse](/wiki/Old_Norse \"Old Norse\") *hildr*, [Old English](/wiki/Old_English \"Old English\") *hild*).\\[[5]\\](#cite_note-5 \"#cite_note-5\") Simek also mentions the interpretation \"heavenly body, star\".\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-SIMEK285-286-6 \"#cite_note-SIMEK285-286-6\")\n\n## Placement\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Placement\")\\]\nThe figures [Fulla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\") (*Uolla*) and [Frigg](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") (*Friia*) are attested together in later Old Norse sources (though not as sisters), and theories have been proposed that Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. This notion has resulted in a theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of Sinthgunt and Sunna/Sól, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-BOSTOCK29-7 \"#cite_note-BOSTOCK29-7\") Similarly, [Wolfgang Beck](/w/index.php?title=Wolfgang_Beck&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Wolfgang Beck (page does not exist)\") \\[[de](<https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Beck_(Germanist)> \"de:Wolfgang Beck (Germanist)\")\\] analysed her as a subordinate goddess from Sunna's retinue, a kind of \"situation goddess\", based on her unique appearance in the sources.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-8 \"#cite_note-8\")\n\n[Friedrich Kauffmann](/wiki/Friedrich_Kauffmann \"Friedrich Kauffmann\") classified Sinhtgunt as a [valkyrie](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\") in the 19th century, because the elements *-gund* and *-hild* appear frequently in their names.\\[[9]\\](#cite_note-9 \"#cite_note-9\") Stefan Schaffner and Heiner Eichner more recently agreed with him, based on Günter Müller's paper on the valkyries' healing powers.\\[[10]\\](#cite_note-10 \"#cite_note-10\")\n\n[Karl Helm](/wiki/Karl_Helm \"Karl Helm\") rejected Kauffmann and grouped Sinhtgunt with the [Idisi](/wiki/Idisi \"Idisi\") of the [First Merseburg Charm](/wiki/First_Merseburg_Charm \"First Merseburg Charm\"), as a specially defined group of Germanic goddesses.\\[[11]\\](#cite_note-11 \"#cite_note-11\")\n\n## Notes\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Notes\")\\]\n\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-ORCHARD112_1-0 \"#cite_ref-ORCHARD112_1-0\")** Orchard (1997:112).\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-2 \"#cite_ref-2\")** [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\"). *Studien über die Entstehung der nordischen Götter- und Heldensagen*.

But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war,\nif you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that\nAntichrist--I really believe he is Antichrist--I will have nothing more\nto do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my 'faithful\nslave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened\nyou--sit down and tell me all the news.\"\n\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna\nScherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With\nthese words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and\nimportance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna\nhad had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la\ngrippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the\nelite.\n\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered\nby a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n\n\"If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the\nprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,\nI shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10--Annette\nScherer.\"\n\n\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the least\ndisconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an\nembroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on\nhis breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that\nrefined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and\nwith the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance\nwho had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna,\nkissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,\nand complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n\n\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's mind\nat rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and\naffected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be\ndiscerned.\n\n\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like\nthese if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You are staying the\nwhole evening, I hope?\"\n\n\"And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I must\nput in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is coming for\nme to take me there.\"\n\n\"I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these\nfestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\n\n\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been\nput off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit\nsaid things he did not even wish to be believed.\n\n\"Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's\ndispatch? You know everything.\"\n\n\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold, listless\ntone. \"What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has\nburnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.\"\n\n","extracted_metadata":{"Content-Length":["3045"],"Content-Encoding":["ISO-8859-1"],"X-TIKA:Parsed-By":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.csv.TextAndCSVParser"],"Content-Type":["text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1"],"X-TIKA:Parsed-By-Full-Set":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.csv.TextAndCSVParser"],"resourceName":["book-war-and-peace-1p.txt"]},"metadata_field_count":6,"attempts":1,"timestamp":1752386801.9422693,"platform":"Linux","python_version":"3.13.5"},{"file_path":"test_documents/text/selected_pdfs.txt","file_size":2374,"file_type":"txt","category":"tiny","framework":"extractous","iteration":2,"extraction_time":0.04830622673034668,"startup_time":null,"peak_memory_mb":631.48828125,"avg_memory_mb":631.48828125,"peak_cpu_percent":40.8,"avg_cpu_percent":8.16,"total_io_mb":null,"status":"success","character_count":2375,"word_count":337,"error_type":null,"error_message":null,"quality_metrics":{"char_count":2375,"word_count":337,"sentence_count":46,"paragraph_count":6,"avg_word_length":6.029673590504451,"avg_sentence_length":7.913043478260869,"extraction_completeness":1.0,"text_coherence":0.8260869565217391,"noise_ratio":0.0,"gibberish_ratio":0.13924050632911392,"flesch_reading_ease":31.25250179629964,"gunning_fog_index":13.869193461469374,"has_proper_formatting":true,"maintains_line_breaks":true,"preserves_whitespace":false,"table_structure_preserved":false,"format_specific_score":0.0,"expected_content_preserved":false},"overall_quality_score":0.43308736637580936,"extracted_text":"# Selected PDFs for Benchmarking\n\n## Small PDFs (< 100KB)\n1.

He moved to Huddersfield Town in 1990 where he remained\nfor three seasons before transferring to Leicester City. Roberts signed for Wolverhampton\nWanderers after three further seasons, but stayed for a single campaign before transferring\nto Norwich City, where he spent seven years. He played international football for Wales and\namassed fifteen caps between 1989 and 2001, without scoring.\nRoberts made 647 league appearances during his career, almost half of which were for\nNorwich, where he overcame a weak start to become a fan favourite. At his peak, he scored\n61 goals in three seasons, and finished with two goals in his final game as Norwich achieved\npromotion to the Premiership. He was elected to the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame in\n2002, while still at the club. His professional career ended with spells at Gillingham and on\nloan to Cambridge United.\nSince retiring as a player, Roberts, who speaks fluent Welsh, has worked as a commentator\nfor Sky Sports, BBC Radio Cymru and BBC Cymru Wales. His book, All I Want for\nChristmas ..., a reference to his gap-toothed appearance, prompted both controversy and\npraise when it was published in 2004.\nIwan Wyn Roberts was born in Bangor, Gwynedd, on 26 June 1968,[1] and grew up in\nBarmouth, on the west coast of Wales as a Liverpool fan.[2]\nRoberts says that most football fans would know him (\"if you know me at all\") as \"that gaptoothed ginger lunk\".[3] He started losing his front tooth when he was just 10: his best\nfriend's heel chipping half of his tooth off, the result of an incident playing football.[4] Some\nyears later, a dentist removed the stump when an abscess developed.[4] He lost his second\nfront tooth as the result of an elbow to the mouth from Darran Rowbotham when he was\n18,[5]\n playing for Watford in a pre-season friendly.[4]\nEarly life\n2005 â�� Cambridge United (loan) 11 (3)\nTotal 647 (202)\nInternational career\n1989â��2001 Wales 15 (0)\n1994 Wales B 1 (1)\nManagerial career\n2004 Gillingham (joint-caretaker)\n*Club domestic league appearances and goals\nRoberts credits his school PE teacher, Iolo Owen, as a great influence in his career,\nintroducing him into men's football aged 15: \"He picked me for the school team and got me\ninto the local men's team, Harlech Town ... as he was the manager ... it toughened me up\nand made me a lot stronger.\"[6] Critical to Roberts' thinking when he joined Watford was\nthat coach Tom Walley was, like himself, Welsh-speaking, as was professional Malcolm\nAllen, against whom Roberts had played in the local Welsh leagues.[7] He was also\ninfluenced by Graham Taylor's record of giving youth players opportunities.[8] Roberts\njoined Watford as a trainee, signing his first professional contract in July 1986, shortly after\nhis 18th birthday.[9]\nRoberts made his first-team debut during the 1985â��86 season and scored his first goal in professional football on 16 September 1986; it was the\nonly goal in a 1â��0 win against Manchester United at Vicarage Road.\n[10] Having made only one full first team appearance for Watford prior to the\nmatch, Roberts came on as a second-half substitute to score the winning goal from a narrow angle.[11] Watford ended the season in ninth\nposition,[12] and despite having three years of his contract remaining, Taylor left the club to join Aston Villa.\n[13] Roberts broke through in the\nfollowing season, making 31 appearances in all competitions and scoring three goals, but Watford finished 19th in the table and were relegated to\nthe Second Division.\n[14][15] The 1988â��89 season saw him make 32 appearances in total, scoring six goals,[16] with Watford finishing fourth, but\nfailing to progress past the 1989 Football League play-offs.\n[17] Roberts' chances were restricted the following season, when he made just nine\nleague appearances, scoring twice.[18]\nHe scored nine goals in 63 league matches in total for Watford,[19] but felt that he was failing to get enough opportunities and moved to Division\nThree club Huddersfield Town prior to the start of the 1990â��91 season, for Â£275,000.[8][19][20] One of his contemporaries at Watford was future\nNorwich City manager, Glenn Roeder. Roberts remembers Roeder as \"an absolute gentleman ... I can't speak highly enough of him. He helped me\na great deal with his experience and any problems that the young lads had they knew he would help them with.\"[21]\nRoberts credits a lot of his success as a striker to the interaction he had with Huddersfield's then first-team coach, Peter Withe: \"Peter was\nexceptional in the air and he taught me so much on how to use my physicality properly and how to move defenders about especially in the penalty\nbox which would enable me a bit more time and space in the box.\"[22] The club then signed Frank Stapleton, who helped the young Roberts\ndevelop \"awareness in the opposition's penalty box\" and how to \"steal goals\" to increase his goal tally, getting a final touch to 'help' a goalbound\nball cross the line.[22]\nThe 1991â��92 season brought Roberts a club post-war record 34 goals in a season, 24 of which were in the league, making him joint top-scorer in\nthe division.[2][8][23] His efforts helped the club to finish third and qualify for the play-offs.\n[24] There they lost to Peterborough United where\nRoberts failed to score in either leg.[8][25] Overall, whilst playing for Huddersfield he scored 50 goals in 142 games.[26][27][28][29]\nIn November\nClub career\nWatford\nHuddersfield Town\n1993 he was signed by the Second Division club Leicester City for Â£300,000.[19][30] Neil Warnock, Huddersfield's manager, needed to sell players\nand Leicester manager Brian Little took an interest.[31]\nRoberts made his debut for Leicester in a Midlands derby against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n[31] At half time, Leicester were two goals behind\nand he expected manager Brian Little, \"the nicest man\" he ever played for to rant in the dressing room, but instead he quietly told the players he\nwas going to make two substitutions.[32]\nIn the second half, Roberts scored two goals to secure a draw.[32] After retiring, Roberts said he still\nregretted not completing a hat-trick in the match, a feat he did achieve in April 1994, in a 28-minute spell against local rivals Derby County.\n[31] As\nrecently as 2017, this achievement is still recalled in a chant by Leicester City fans.[33] Roberts broke some ribs a few weeks later and returned to\nthe first-team squad just in time for the 1993â��94 play-off final, which Leicester won 2â��1 against Derby.[31]\nIn the 1994â��95 Premiership, Leicester struggled and were relegated, but Roberts was the club's top scorer with 11 goals in all competitions.[31][34]\nHe scored another 19 goals the following season, as Leicester reached the play-offs again.[35]\nIn the semi-final, Leicester drew 0-0 with Stoke City\nin the first leg at home and won 1-0 in the second leg from a Garry Parker goal, to qualify for the final.\n[36] What followed was one of the only two\nincidents that \"bugged\" Roberts during his playing career: while celebrating the win, he suddenly realised he was in danger due to a pitch invasion\nby Stoke supporters.[36] He managed to escape, but some of his team-mates, including Neil Lennon and Muzzy Izzet were less fortunate, and had\nto be protected by police.[36][37] Although it was reported that Roberts had recovered from injury,[38] he was not selected for the squad for the\nplay-off final against Crystal Palace. Leicester won the match which secured them promotion to the Premiership.[35] With the side promoted again,\nLeicester decided to sell Roberts to Wolves.[31] In all, Roberts scored 41 goals in 100 league games for Leicester.[19]\nHis goals and performances for Leicester persuaded Wolves to sign Roberts for Â£1.3m in the summer of 1996.[39] He spent only one season at\nMolineux in which he scored 12 goals in 33 games, including one hat-trick for the club in a match against their local rivals West Bromwich Albion\nin the Black Country derby.\n[39][40] Wolves ended the season in third place but lost 4â��3 on aggregate to Crystal Palace in the play-offs, with Roberts\nfailing to score in either leg.[41]\nIn the summer off-season of 1997, Roberts returned from holiday and came into the club for the first day of pre-season training where manager\nMark McGhee called him into his office. There McGhee said that he had been told that in order to bring in new players, he had to sell first, and that\nRoberts was the only player for whom an offer had been made â�� by Norwich City.[42] Roberts did not want to leave the club, but accepted that if\nthe manager did not want him there, he needed to go.[42]\nIn July 1997, Norwich City manager Mike Walker paid Â£850,000 to Wolves to secure the services of Roberts.[43] His time at the club (nicknamed\nthe Canaries) did not begin happily, however. Following his debut in August 1997 against his former club Wolves, he struggled throughout the\n1997â��98 season and scored just seven goals; \"there were certainly those in the stands who were questioning whether he was worth the near\nÂ£1,000,000 splashed out on him\".[44] There were crowd chants about him being a \"waste of money\" and Roberts remembers that someone wrote\nLeicester City\nWolverhampton Wanderers\nNorwich City\nto the Eastern Daily Press and described him as \"the worst ever to wear a Norwich shirt\", adding the reflection that \"it was the bleakest period of\nall my years as a pro.\"[42] Roberts had scored just four goals heading into the end of the season; however, his fitness slowly began to improve and\n\"three goals in the final two home games of the season left in good heart for the next campaign\".[44] Walker was sacked at the end of the season,\nand Roberts blames himself for this happening â�� a result of his lack of goals.[42]\nWalker was replaced during the summer by Bruce Rioch. During pre-season training, Roberts weighed in at 15 stone 3 pounds (97 kg), with a body\nfat ratio of 16â��17%, when his \"fighting weight\" should have been \"just under 14 stone with around 13 per cent body fat.\"[45] The turnaround was,\naccording to Roberts, due to some clever psychology by Rioch:\n\"Bruce was very clever: he didn't issue me with an ultimatum, he didn't rant and rave or threaten me. He just said, \"Tom Walley would\nbe proud of you\". Tom was my youth team manager at Watford and absolutely hated people being out of shape ... It was a gentle hint,\nbut I realised ... I had to sort it out myself.\"[45]\nRoberts threw himself into weight training and soon reached a target weight of 13 stone 10 pounds.[45]\nIt paid off: that season, Roberts scored 23\ngoals.[44] He was partnered by what the Eastern Daily Press described as the \"flourishing talent\" of Craig Bellamy who scored 19 goals. Norwich\nfinished in the top half of the table and the Canaries fans voted Roberts player of the season.\n[44]\nIn the 1999â��2000 season he was again top scorer\n(19 goals in 49 games) and retained the player of the season award. He just missed out on becoming the first player in the club's history to win the\naward three years in a row when Andy Marshall finished narrowly ahead of him in the voting for the 2000â��01 season.\n[46]\nDuring that 1999â��2000 campaign there was speculation about Roberts's future as his contract was due to expire in the summer of 2000.[47]\nRoberts had an agent, former team-mate and close friend David Speedie, who advised him to turn down Norwich's offer and sign for Nottingham\nForest or Huddersfield Town. Ultimately, \"he couldn't produce anything on paper that told me I'd be signing ... so I could have got injured in\ntraining, never played again and not got a penny.\"[47] As a result, the two men fell out and Roberts did not use the services of an agent again,\nrepresenting himself in contract negotiations.[47] Shortly after he signed a contract extension in January of that season, Bruce Rioch left the club\nand was succeeded by Bryan Hamilton. Roberts helped Hamilton make a good start when he scored both goals in a 2â��0 win at Portman Road\nagainst City's East Anglian derby rivals Ipswich Town on 19 March 2000.[48]\nAlthough Roberts was personally enjoying the most productive spell of his career, his first four years at Carrow Road had seen the club struggle.\nThey had barely threatened to qualify for the end of season play-offs, ending the 2000â��01 campaign in 15th place, six points above the relegation\nzone.[49] The 2001â��02 season, with new manager Nigel Worthington in his first full season in charge,[50] saw the team fare better and they\nreached the Division One play-off final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.\n[51] Roberts missed much of the second half of the season because of\ninjury, but came off the substitute's bench in the final to give Norwich the lead in the first minute of extra-time with a header. Norwich lost the\nmatch in a penalty shoot-out after Birmingham City had equalised. Roberts took â�� and scored â�� the first penalty of the shoot-out but misses by\nPhil Mulryne and Daryl Sutch meant Birmingham won 4â��2 and were promoted to the Premiership.[52]\nDuring the 2002â��03 season, Roberts captained the Norwich team. That season, in a match against Sheffield Wednesday at Carrow Road, Roberts\nscored twice to move into third place on the list of Norwich City's all-time leading goalscorers, overtaking Robert Fleck in the process.[53] The\nCanaries faded after a good start to the season, finishing in eighth place and failing to qualify for the play-offs.[54] Roberts scored just 7 goals in 47\ngames.[55] The 2003â��04 season would be his last at Carrow Road and although he was no longer an regular starter for the first team he played an\nUnder Nigel Worthington,\nRoberts became club\ncaptain, but also finished his\nNorwich City career.\nimportant part in one of the club's best-ever seasons. The team won the title and were promoted to the\nPremiership.[56] Roberts scored some important goals, including the winning strike in a top-of-the-table match\nagainst Sheffield United.\n[57] Roberts revealed in his autobiography that in February of that season he had a cancer\nscare and had to have a malignant melanoma removed from his arm.[58]\nA few days before the club's last home match of the 2003â��04 season, Worthington announced that Roberts would not\nbe offered a new contract when his deal expired that summer. Worthington felt that, following promotion to the\nPremiership, the club had to look to the future and that Roberts was now surplus to requirements.[59] Although he\nhad made 41 league appearances that season, he started just 13 games.[60] With the championship already won,\nWorthington restored Roberts to the starting line-up for the last game of the season at Gresty Road against Crewe\nAlexandra and made him captain for the day. Roberts scored twice as City won 3â��1;[61] he described the occasion and\nthe goal: \"I'd never scored on the final day of a season before, it was my final game in a Norwich shirt, which was a\nvery sad occasion, Nigel Worthington made me captain for the day and I'll be forever thankful for that, and I managed\nto cap it all off by getting two goals. One of them was a left footed volley into the top corner and I haven't got too\nmany of those in my career!\"[2]\n Overall, Roberts scored 96 goals in 306 games for Norwich.[61]\nAfter being released by Norwich, he received a number of offers to play for other clubs, including from Swiss side FC\nBasel, but eventually signed a two-year contract with Gillingham of the Championship, where he would be\nplayer/coach.[59] His debut was against Ipswich, Norwich's local rivals, and was booked after less than five seconds.[5] The move to Gillingham did\nnot prove a good one for him and he had a number of disagreements with the club, particularly with Stan Ternent after he succeeded Andy\nHessenthaler as manager.[5][62]\nIn December 2004 Roberts had himself served as joint caretaker manager, along with Darren Hare and Paul\nSmith, after the sudden departure of both Hessenthaler and initial caretaker John Gorman.\n[5]\nIn March 2005 he joined Cambridge United on loan\nuntil the end of the season to play under the management of former Norwich team-mate, Rob Newman.\n[2] He scored his 200th league goal on his\ndebut,[5] but Cambridge were relegated from League Two.[63] In August 2005, Roberts retired from playing after reaching an agreement with\nGillingham to pay the final year of his contract.[62]\nWhile a Watford player, Roberts was called up for Wales for the first time, an April 1989 friendly game against Israel.\n[64] He made his debut for the\nWelsh national team on 11 October 1989, when he took to the field in a 2â��1 defeat to the Netherlands in a World Cup qualifier at the Racecourse\nGround, Wrexham. With both Ian Rush and Mark Hughes suspended, Roberts started the game alongside Malcolm Allen.[65] He had to wait more\nthan two years for his next international appearance, when his domestic form for Huddersfield saw him leading scorer in Division Two.[23] Roberts\nplayed in a 1â��1 friendly against Austria in April 1992.[66] He earned two more caps that year at the Kirin Cup in Japan, suffering a 1â��0 loss against\nArgentina and receiving a red card in a 1â��0 victory over the host nation for a foul on Masami Ihara.\n[66][67] Roberts made three appearances for the\nsenior Wales team in 1994, including two qualification matches for UEFA Euro 1996 against Albania and Moldova.\n[66] He was not selected for\nWales again until 2000 when he made three appearances in friendlies, all losses against Finland, Brazil and Portugal.\n[66]\nGillingham and Cambridge United\nInternational career\nBellamy playing for Wales\nin 2011\nRoberts made four more appearances for his country in the qualification stages for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in 2000 and 2001.\n[66] He won a total\nof 15 caps for his country over a 12-year period, including a single appearance and one goal for the Wales B team,[68] but failed to score for the\nsenior team.[66] Roberts is phlegmatic that he made only 17 appearances (\"most as substitute\") for Wales, as he \"had to compete against the likes\nof Mark Hughes, Ian Rush, Dean Saunders, so there were some world-class strikers before me and I was just happy to get in the squad.\"[2] He\nregards the fact that he did not score for Wales as the greatest regret of his career.[69]\nStanding at 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m),[1] Roberts was known for scoring a high proportion of his goals with headers.[70] He had\na strong partnership with Craig Bellamy, beginning when Bellamy broke into the Norwich first team in 1997, aged\n18.[71] They also featured together for Wales, although Roberts never managed to score in 15 appearances for the\nnational side. Roberts said \"I absolutely loved playing up-front with [Bellamy] ... we hit it off straight away, probably\nmore so than anyone else I ever played with. It was like telepathy between us.\"[69] He described the relationship as \"the\nclassic big man, little man\" and noted that in their first season together for Norwich, Roberts scored 24 goals and\nBellamy 17.[69]\nIn 2004, Roberts published an account of his last season at Norwich, entitled All I want for Christmas .... The title of\nthe book was a joke based on Roberts' missing front teeth, a reference to the song \"All I Want for Christmas Is My Two\nFront Teeth\".[5] The book proved controversial, because it included an admission of a deliberate stamp on Wolves\ndefender Kevin Muscat, an incident that had taken place in 2000:\n\"As I got up I 'lost my balance' and trod on his back. Fourteen stone through eight studs, you do the maths.\nHe was in agony, but the ref didn't see it so I got away with it. Of course, I pulled him up and said 'Sorry\nmate, sorry mate', but he knew.\"[72]\nRoberts stated in the book that the stamp was a payback for a serious injury that Muscat had inflicted on Craig Bellamy while Bellamy and Roberts\nwere playing together for Norwich, and that Muscat held no grudges over it.[73]\nBecause of the coverage in the book, the Football Association retrospectively investigated the incident and Roberts, then playing at Gillingham,\nwas banned for three matches and fined Â£2,500 for the offence.[74] Roberts commented that this \"left 'a bitter taste' â�� especially after England\ncaptain David Beckham escaped without a punishment for his deliberate foul in the World Cup qualifier against Wales.\"[75] The Football\nAssociation said there was \"insufficient evidence\" to charge Beckham with bringing the game into disrepute. This was \"despite his admission in\nStyle of play\nAll I Want for Christmas ...\nIwan Roberts appearances, goals and scoring rate\nThe Daily Telegraph and subsequent apology.\"[76] At the time, Roberts told The Daily Telegraph, \"I do not want players to get suspensions and\nfines, but there must be consistency, regardless of who the player is.\"[76] The book was praised by critics. The Daily Telegraph called it \"a rollicking\ngood read. If it doesn't make you at least smile, then it's time to seek counselling.\"[77]\nRoberts has the UEFA A Licence for football coaching and, speaking in 2007, had not ruled out getting into management. He told the Eastern\nDaily Press, \"I've done my qualifications. It's just getting a club to give me a chance and taking it.\"[21] When Norwich sacked Nigel Worthington,\nRoberts applied for the manager's job. \"I tried to go for it ... knowing I wasn't going to get it but I'd never really been for an interview and I thought\nif I did it would stand me in good stead. But I never got a response from the club and that really disappointed me. A week after Peter Grant got the\njob I got a letter through the post saying 'We won't be considering you this time'.

in Germanic mythology, attested solely in the Old High German 9th- or 10th-century Second Merseburg Charm. In the verse charm, Sinthgunt is referred to as the sister of the personified sun, Sunna (whose name is alliterative to Sinthgunt),[1] and the two sisters are cited as both producing incantations to heal the horse of Phol, another otherwise unattested figure but possibly the same as Balder, who is named elsewhere in the charm. The two are then followed by Friia and Uolla, also alliterative and stated as sisters.\n\nAs Sinthgunt is otherwise unattested, her significance is otherwise unknown, but some scholarly theories exist about her role in Germanic mythology based on proposed etymologies and the potential significance of her placement within the poem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEtymology\n[edit]\n\nThe etymology of Sinthgunt is unclear.  In the original manuscript, Sinthgunt is spelled Sinhtgunt (emphasis added). In the 19th century, Sophus Bugge stuck strictly to this reading, proposing a complex compound based on Germanic *Sin-naχt-gund, i.e., \"the night-walking one\".[2] As a result of the pairing with Sunna, the personified sun (corresponding to Old Norse Sól), this etymology has been interpreted as a reference to the moon. However, this reading has yielded problems; the moon in Germanic mythology is considered masculine, exemplified in the personification of the moon in Norse mythology, Máni, a male figure. According to Rudolf Simek, the historical record lacks evidence for any cult of personified celestial bodies among the ancient Germanic peoples.[3]\n\nStefan Schaffner rejects this etymology, as does Heiner Eichner [de], because the first element Sinht- cannot be based on the presupposed earlier Germanic *sinχt-. Such a Germanic form would have yielded Old High German *sīht by regular sound change.[4] The amended Sinthgunt presupposes a Proto-Germanic compound *Senþa-gunþjō, the first element meaning \"raid, (military) campaign\", the second one \"fight\". This interpretation corresponds well to other Old High German female names such as Sindhilt (from *Senþa-χilðijō, with its second element also meaning \"fight\", cf. Old Norse hildr, Old English hild).[5] Simek also mentions the interpretation \"heavenly body, star\".[6]\n\n\nPlacement\n[edit]\n\nThe figures Fulla (Uolla) and Frigg (Friia) are attested together in later Old Norse sources (though not as sisters), and theories have been proposed that Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. This notion has resulted in a theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of Sinthgunt and Sunna/Sól, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.[7] Similarly, Wolfgang Beck [de] analysed her as a subordinate goddess from Sunna's retinue, a kind of \"situation goddess\", based on her unique appearance in the sources.[8]\n\nFriedrich Kauffmann classified Sinhtgunt as a valkyrie in the 19th century, because the elements -gund and -hild appear frequently in their names.[9] Stefan Schaffner and Heiner Eichner more recently agreed with him, based on Günter Müller's paper on the valkyries' healing powers.[10] \n\nKarl Helm rejected Kauffmann and grouped Sinhtgunt with the Idisi of the First Merseburg Charm, as a specially defined group of Germanic goddesses.[11]\n\n\nNotes\n[edit]\n\n\n\t^ Orchard (1997:112).\n\n\t^ Sophus Bugge.

Kernighan\n\nABSTRACT\n\nMuch of the power of the UNIX operating system comes from a style of program\ndesign that makes programs easy to use and, more important, easy to combine with other\nprograms. This style has been called the use of software tools, and depends more on how\nthe programs fit into the programming environment � how they can be used with other\nprograms � than on how they are designed internally. But as the system has become\ncommercially successful and has spread widely, this style has often been compromised, to\nthe detriment of all users. Old programs have become encrusted with dubious features.\nNewer programs are not always written with attention to proper separation of function\nand design for interconnection. This paper discusses the elements of program design,\nshowing by example good and bad design, and indicates some possible trends for the\nfuture.\n\nThe UNIX operating system has become a great commercial success, and is likely to be the standard\noperating system for microcomputers and some mainframes in the coming years.\n\nThere are good reasons for this popularity. One is portability: the operating system kernel and the\napplications programs are written in the programming language C, and thus can be moved from one type of\ncomputer to another with much less effort than would be involved in recreating them in the assembly lan-\nguage of each machine. Essentially the same operating system therefore runs on a wide variety of comput-\ners, and users needn’t learn a new system when new hardware comes along. Perhaps more important, ven-\ndors that sell the UNIX system needn’t provide new software for each new machine; instead, their software\ncan be compiled and run without change on any hardware, which makes the system commercially attrac-\ntive. There is also an element of zealotry: users of the system tend to be enthusiastic and to expect it wher-\never they go; the students who used the UNIX system in university a few years ago are now in the job mar-\nket and often demand it as a condition of employment.\n\nBut the UNIX system was popular long before it was even portable, let alone a commercial success.\nThe reasons for that are more interesting.\n\nExcept for the initial PDP-7 version, the UNIX system was written for the DEC PDP-11, a machine that\nwas (deservedly) very popular. PDP-11’s were powerful enough to do real computing, but small enough to\nbe affordable by small organizations such as academic departments in universities.\n\nThe early UNIX system was smaller but more effective and technically more interesting than compet-\ning systems on the same hardware. It provided a number of innovative applications of computer science,\nshowing the benefits to be obtained by a judicious blend of theory and practice. Examples include the\nyacc parser-generator, the diff file comparison program, and the pervasive use of regular expressions to\ndescribe string patterns. These led in turn to new programming languages and interesting software for\napplications like program development, document preparation and circuit design.\n\nSince the system was modest in size, and since essentially everything was written in C, the software\nwas easy to modify, to customize for particular applications or merely to support a view of the world\n__________________\n UNIX is a trademark of Bell Laboratories.\n\n\n\n- 2 -\n\ndifferent from the original. (This ease of change is also a weakness, of course, as evidenced by the plethora\nof different versions of the system.)\n\nFinally, the UNIX system provided a new style of computing, a new way of thinking of how to attack\na problem with a computer. This style was based on the use of tools: using programs separately or in com-\nbination to get a job done, rather than doing it by hand, by monolithic self-sufficient subsystems, or by\nspecial-purpose, one-time programs. This has been much discussed in the literature, so we don’t need to\nrepeat it here; see [1], for example.\n\nThe style of use and design of the tools on the system are closely related. The style is still evolving,\nand is the subject of this essay: in particular, how the design and use of a program fit together, how the\ntools fit into the environment, and how the style influences solutions to new problems. The focus of the\ndiscussion is a single example, the program cat, which concatenates a set of files onto its standard output.\ncat is a simple program, both in implementation and in use; it is essential to the UNIX system; and it is a\ngood illustration of the kinds of decisions that delight both supporters and critics of the system. (Often a\nsingle property of the system will be taken as an asset or as a fault by different audiences; our audience is\nprogrammers, because the UNIX environment is designed fundamentally for programming.) Even the\nname cat is typical of UNIX program names: it is short, pronounceable, but not conventional English for\nthe job it does. (For an opposing viewpoint, see [2].) Most important, though, cat in its usages and varia-\ntions exemplifies UNIX program design style and how it has been interpreted by different communities.\n\n11/3/71 CAT (I)\n\nNAME c_a_t_ -- concatenate and print\n\nSYNOPSIS c_a_t_ f_i_l_e_1_ ...\n\nDESCRIPTION c_a_t_ reads each file in sequence and writes it on\nthe standard output stream. Thus:\n\nc_a_t_ f_i_l_e_\n\nis about the easiest way to print a file. Also:\n\nc_a_t_ f_i_l_e_1_ f_i_l_e_2_ >f_i_l_e_3_\n\nis about the easiest way to concatenate files.\n\nIf no input file is given c_a_t_ reads from the\nstandard input file.\n\nFILES --\n\nSEE ALSO pr, cp\n\nDIAGNOSTICS none; if a file cannot be found it is ignored.\n\nBUGS --\n\nOWNER ken, dmr\n\nFigure 1: Manual page for cat, UNIX 1st Edition, November, 1971\n\nFigure 1 is the manual page for cat from the UNIX 1st Edition manual. Evidently, cat copies its input to\nits output. The input is normally taken from a sequence of one or more files, but it can come from the stan-\ndard input. The output is the standard output. The manual suggests two uses, the general file copy:\n\n\n\n- 3 -\n\ncat file1 file2 >file3\n\nand printing a file on the terminal:\n\ncat file\n\nThe general case is certainly what was intended in the design of the program. Output redirection (provided\nby the > operator, implemented by the UNIX shell) makes cat a fine general-purpose file concatenator and\na valuable adjunct for other programs, which can use cat to process filenames, as in:\n\ncat file file2 ... | other-program\n\nThe fact that cat will also print on the terminal is a special case. Perhaps surprisingly, in practice it turns\nout that the special case is the main use of the program. \n\nThe design of cat is typical of most UNIX programs: it implements one simple but general function\nthat can be used in many different applications (including many not envisioned by the original author).\nOther commands are used for other functions. For example, there are separate commands for file system\ntasks like renaming files, deleting them or telling how big they are. Other systems instead lump these into a\nsingle ‘‘file system’’ command with an internal structure and command language of its own. (The PIP file\ncopy program found on operating systems like CP/M or RSX-11 is an example.) That approach is not neces-\nsarily worse or better, but it is certainly against the UNIX philosophy. Unfortunately, such programs are\nnot completely alien to the UNIX system � some mail-reading programs and text editors, for example, are\nlarge self-contained ‘‘subsystems’’ that provide their own complete environments and mesh poorly with the\nrest of the system. Most such subsystems, however, are usually imported from or inspired by programs on\nother operating systems with markedly different programming environments.\n\nThere are some significant advantages to the traditional UNIX system approach. The most important\nis that the surrounding environment � the shell and the programs it can invoke � provides a uniform\naccess to system facilities. Filename argument patterns are expanded by the shell for all programs, without\nprearrangement in each command. The same is true of input and output redirection. Pipes are a natural\noutgrowth of redirection. Rather than decorate each command with options for all relevant pre- and post-\nprocessing, each program expects as input, and produces as output, concise and header-free textual data that\nconnects well with other programs to do the rest of the task at hand. It takes some programming discipline\nto build a program that works well in this environment � primarily, to avoid the temptation to add features\nthat conflict with or duplicate services provided by other commands � but it’s well worthwhile.\n\nGrowth is easy when the functions are well separated. For example, the 7th Edition shell was aug-\nmented with a backquote operator that converts the output of one program into the arguments to another, as\nin\n\ncat ‘cat filelist‘\n\nNo changes were made in any other program when this operator was invented; because the backquote is\ninterpreted by the shell, all programs called by the shell acquire the feature transparently and uniformly. If\nspecial characters like backquotes were instead interpreted, even by calling a standard subroutine, by each\nprogram that found the feature appropriate, every program would require (at least) recompilation whenever\nsomeone had a new idea. Not only would uniformity be hard to enforce, but experimentation would be\nharder because of the effort of installing any changes.\n\nThe UNIX 7th Edition system introduced two changes in cat. First, files that could not be read,\neither because of denied permissions or simple non-existence, were reported rather than ignored. Second,\nand less desirable, was the addition of a single optional argument -u, which forced cat to unbuffer its out-\nput (the reasons for this option, which has disappeared again in the 8th Edition of the system, are technical\nand irrelevant here.)\n\nBut the existence of one argument was enough to suggest more, and other versions of the system\n__________________\n The use of cat to feed a single input file to a program has to some degree superseded the shell’s < operator, which illus-\ntrates that general-purpose constructs � like cat and pipes � are often more natural than convenient special-purpose\nones.\n\n\n\n- 4 -\n\nsoon embellished cat with features. This list comes from cat on the Berkeley distribution of the UNIX\nsystem:\n\n-s strip multiple blank lines to a single instance\n-n number the output lines\n-b number only the non-blank lines\n-v make non-printing characters visible\n\n-ve mark ends of lines\n-vt change representation of tab\n\nIn System V, there are similar options and even a clash of naming: -s instructs cat to be silent\nabout non-existent files. But none of these options are appropriate additions to cat; the reasons get to the\nheart of how UNIX programs are designed and why they work well together.\n\nIt’s easy to dispose of (Berkeley) -s, -n and -b: all of these jobs are readily done with existing tools\nlike sed and awk. For example, to number lines, this awk invocation suffices:\n\nawk ’{ print NR \"\\t\" $0 }’ filenames\n\nIf line-numbering is needed often, this command can be packaged under a name like linenumber and put\nin a convenient public place. Another possibility is to modify the pr command, whose job is to format text\nsuch as program source for output on a line printer. Numbering lines is an appropriate feature in pr; in fact\nUNIX System V pr has a -n option to do so. There never was a need to modify cat; these options are\ngratuitous tinkering.\n\nBut what about -v? That prints non-printing characters in a visible representation. Making strange\ncharacters visible is a genuinely new function, for which no existing program is suitable. (‘‘sed -n l’’,\nthe closest standard possibility, aborts when given very long input lines, which are more likely to occur in\nfiles containing non-printing characters.) So isn’t it appropriate to add the -v option to cat to make\nstrange characters visible when a file is printed?\n\nThe answer is ‘‘No.’’ Such a modification confuses what cat’s job is � concatenating files � with\nwhat it happens to do in a common special case � showing a file on the terminal. A UNIX program\nshould do one thing well, and leave unrelated tasks to other programs. cat’s job is to collect the data in\nfiles. Programs that collect data shouldn’t change the data; cat therefore shouldn’t transform its input.\n\nThe preferred approach in this case is a separate program that deals with non-printable characters.\nWe called ours vis (a suggestive, pronounceable, non-English name) because its job is to make things vis-\nible. As usual, the default is to do what most users will want � make strange characters visible � and as\nnecessary include options for variations on that theme. By making vis a separate program, related useful\nfunctions are easy to provide. For example, the option -s strips out (i.e., discards) strange characters,\nwhich is handy for dealing with files from other operating systems. Other options control the treatment and\nformat of characters like tabs and backspaces that may or may not be considered strange in different situa-\ntions. Such options make sense in vis because its focus is entirely on the treatment of such characters. In\ncat, they require an entire sub-language within the -v option, and thus get even further away from the\nfundamental purpose of that program. Also, providing the function in a separate program makes conve-\nnient options such as -s easier to invent, because it isolates the problem as well as the solution.\n\nOne possible objection to separate programs for each task is efficiency. For example, if we want\nnumbered lines and visible characters it is probably more efficient to run the one command\n\ncat -n -v file\n\nthan the two-element pipeline\n\nlinenumber file | vis\n\nIn practice, however, cat is usually used with no options, so it makes sense to have the common cases be\nthe efficient ones. The current research version of the cat command is actually about five times faster\nthan the Berkeley and System V versions because it can process data in large blocks instead of the byte-at-\ntime processing that might be required if an option is enabled. Also, and this is perhaps more important, it\nis hard to imagine any of these examples being the bottleneck of a production program. Most of the real\n\n\n\n- 5 -\n\ntime is probably taken waiting for the user’s terminal to display the characters, or even for the user to read\nthem.\n\nSeparate programs are not always better than wider options; which is better depends on the problem.\nWhenever one needs a way to perform a new function, one faces the choice of whether to add a new option\nor write a new program (assuming that none of the programmable tools will do the job conveniently). The\nguiding principle for making the choice should be that each program does one thing. Options are appropri-\nately added to a program that already has the right functionality. If there is no such program, then a new\nprogram is called for. In that case, the usual criteria for program design should be used: the program should\nbe as general as possible, its default behavior should match the most common usage, and it should cooper-\nate with other programs.\n\nLet’s look at these issues in the context of another problem, dealing with fast terminal lines. The first\nversions of the UNIX system were written in the days when 150 baud was ‘‘fast,’’ and all terminals used\npaper. Today, 9600 baud is typical, and hard-copy terminals are rare. How should we deal with the fact\nthat output from programs like cat scrolls off the top of the screen faster than one can read it?\n\nThere are two obvious approaches. One is to tell each program about the properties of terminals, so it\ndoes the right thing (whether by option or automatically). The other is to write a command that handles ter-\nminals, and leave most programs untouched.\n\nAn example of the first approach is Berkeley’s version of the ls command, which lists the filenames\nin a directory. Let us call it lsc to avoid confusion. The 7th Edition ls command lists filenames in a sin-\ngle column, so for a large directory, the list of filenames disappears off the top of the screen at great speed.\nlsc prints in columns across the screen (which is assumed to be 80 columns wide), so there are typically\nfour to eight times as many names on each line, and thus the output usually fits on one screen. The option\n-1 can be used to get the old single-column behavior.\n\nSurprisingly, lsc operates differently if its output is a file or pipe:\n\nlsc\n\nproduces output different from\n\nlsc | cat\n\nThe reason is that lsc begins by examining whether or not its output is a terminal, and prints in columns\nonly if it is. By retaining single-column output to files or pipes, lsc ensures compatibility with programs\nlike grep or wc that expect things to be printed one per line. This ad hoc adjustment of the output format\ndepending on the destination is not only distasteful, it is unique � no standard UNIX command has this\nproperty.\n\nA more insidious problem with lsc is that the columnation facility, which is actually a useful, gen-\neral function, is built in and thus inaccessible to other programs that could use a similar compression. Pro-\ngrams should not attempt special solutions to general problems. The automatic columnation in lsc is rem-\niniscent of the ‘‘wild cards’’ found in some systems that provide filename pattern matching only for a par-\nticular program. The experience with centralized processing of wild cards in the UNIX shell shows over-\nwhelmingly how important it is to centralize the function where it can be used by all programs.\n\nOne solution for the ls problem is obvious � a separate program for columnation, so that columna-\ntion into say 5 columns is just\n\nls | 5\n\nIt is easy to build a first-draft version with the multi-column option of pr. The commands 2, 3, etc., are all\nlinks to a single file:\n\npr -$0 -t -l1 $*\n\n$0 is the program name (2, 3, etc.), so -$0 becomes -n where n is the number of columns that pr is to\nproduce. The other options suppress the normal heading, set the page length to 1 line, and pass the argu-\nments on to pr. This implementation is typical of the use of tools � it takes only a moment to write, and it\nserves perfectly well for most applications. If a more general service is desired, such as automatically\nselecting the number of columns for optimal compaction, a C program is probably required, but the one-\n\n\n\n- 6 -\n\nline implementation above satisfies the immediate need and provides a base for experimentation with the\ndesign of a fancier program, should one become necessary.\n\nSimilar reasoning suggests a solution for the general problem of data flowing off screens (colum-\nnated or not): a separate program to take any input and print it a screen at a time. Such programs are by\nnow widely available, under names like pg and more. This solution affects no other programs, but can be\nused with all of them. As usual, once the basic feature is right, the program can be enhanced with options\nfor specifying screen size, backing up, searching for patterns, and anything else that proves useful within\nthat basic job.\n\nThere is still a problem, of course. If the user forgets to pipe output into pg, the output that goes off\nthe top of the screen is gone. It would be desirable if the facilities of pg were always present without hav-\ning to be requested explicitly.\n\nThere are related useful functions that are typically only available as part of a particular program, not\nin a central service. One example is the history mechanism provided by some versions of the UNIX shell:\ncommands are remembered, so it’s possible to review and repeat them, perhaps with editing. But why\nshould this facility be restricted to the shell? (It’s not even general enough to pass input to programs called\nby the shell; it applies to shell commands only.) Certainly other programs could profit as well; any interac-\ntive program could benefit from the ability to re-execute commands. More subtly, why should the facility\nbe restricted to program input? Pipes have shown that the output from one program is often useful as input\nto another. With a little editing, the output of commands such as ls or make can be turned into commands\nor data for other programs.\n\nAnother facility that could be usefully centralized is typified by the editor escape in some mail com-\nmands. It is possible to pick up part of a mail message, edit it, and then include it in a reply. But this is all\ndone by special facilities within the mail command and so its use is restricted.\n\nEach such service is provided by a different program, which usually has its own syntax and seman-\ntics. This is in contrast to features such as pagination, which is always the same because it is only done by\none program. The editing of input and output text is more environmental than functional; it is more like the\nshell’s expansion of filename metacharacters than automatic numbering of lines of text. But since the shell\ndoes not see the characters sent as input to the programs, it cannot provide such editing. The emacs edi-\ntor3 provides a limited form of this capability, by processing all UNIX command input and output, but this\nis expensive, clumsy, and subjects the users to the complexities and vagaries of yet another massive subsys-\ntem (which isn’t to criticize the inventiveness of the idea).\n\nA potentially simpler solution is to let the terminal or terminal interface do the work, with controlled\nscrolling, editing and retransmission of visible text, and review of what has gone before. We have used the\nprogrammability of the Blit terminal4 � a programmable bitmap graphics display � to capitalize on this\npossibility, to good effect.\n\nThe Blit uses a mouse to point to characters on the display, which can be edited, rearranged and\ntransmitted back to the UNIX system as though they had been typed on the keyboard. Because the terminal\nis essentially simulating typed input, the programs are oblivious to how the text was created; all the features\ndiscussed above are provided by the general editing capabilities of the terminal, with no changes to the\nUNIX programs.\n\nThere are some obvious direct advantages to the Blit’s ability to process text under the user’s control.\nShell history is trivial: commands can be selected with the mouse, edited if desired, and retransmitted.\nSince from the terminal’s viewpoint all text on the display is equivalent, history is limited neither to the\nshell nor to command input. Because the Blit provides editing, most of the interactive features of programs\nlike mail are unnecessary; they are done easily, transparently and uniformly by the terminal.\n\nThe most interesting facet of this work, however, is the way it removes the need for interactive fea-\ntures in programs; instead, the Blit is the place where interaction is provided, much as the shell is the pro-\ngram that interprets filename-matching metacharacters. Unfortunately, of course, programming the termi-\nnal demands access to a part of the environment off-limits to most programmers, but the solution meshes\nwell with the environment and is appealing in its simplicity. If the terminal cannot be modified to provide\nthe capabilities, a user-level program or perhaps the UNIX kernel itself could be modified fairly easily to do\nroughly what the Blit does, with similar results.\n\n\n\n- 7 -\n\nThe key to problem-solving on the UNIX system is to identify the right primitive operations and to\nput them at the right place. UNIX programs tend to solve general problems rather than special cases. In a\nvery loose sense, the programs are orthogonal, spanning the space of jobs to be done (although with a fair\namount of overlap for reasons of history, convenience or efficiency). Functions are placed where they will\ndo the most good: there shouldn’t be a pager in every program that produces output any more than there\nshould be filename pattern matching in every program that uses filenames.\n\nOne thing that UNIX does not need is more features. It is successful in part because it has a small\nnumber of good ideas that work well together. Merely adding features does not make it easier for users to\ndo things � it just makes the manual thicker. The right solution in the right place is always more effective\nthan haphazard hacking.\n\n1. B. W. Kernighan and Rob Pike, The UNIX Programming Environment, Prentice-Hall (1984).\n\n2. D.

The\ninvention of new facilities in computing systems can be guided by these principles. For\nexample, the introduction of networking need not require any change to the majority of\nsystem utilities, because objects such as files on remote machines can be given syntacti-\ncally familiar names within the local machine’s name space. Indeed, the implementers of\nnetworks often do well by these standards by striving to make remote files essentially\nindistinguishable from local ones. Unfortunately, the situation with internetwork mail\naddresses is not as satisfactory. The practitioners of internetworking would profit by\nunderstanding the benefits of simple, uniform syntax.\n\nresearch!ucbvax!@cmu-cs-pt.arpa:@CMU-ITC-LINUS:dave%CMU-ITC-LINUS@CMU-CS-PT\n\n- Carnegie-Mellon University mailer\n\nI cannot tell what the dickens his name is.\n- Shakespeare, Merry Wives of Windsor, II. ii. 20.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAny object relevant to computation — file, process, user, computer, network or whatever — needs a\nname. The name determines the access: it is by interpreting the name, within the name space it inhabits,\nthat a program or person is given access to the object. The manner in which names are constructed affects\nnot only how objects are named but also how they are used.\n\nThe form of names and name spaces is the subject of this essay. We will use file names from several\noperating systems as examples to illustrate criteria for distinguishing good names from bad. The same cri-\nteria may be applied to network mail names, pointing out some of the shortcomings of the current ad hoc\nsystems for internetworking.\n\nThe criteria are not new, and seem to be generally accepted, but are not applied in practice. This\npaper is an attempt to re-establish their use.\n\nPrinciples of Names and Name Spaces\n\nWhat’s in a name? A string of characters, encoded by some convention (ASCII or EBCDIC), that\nidentifies an object. If the function of a name stopped there, this definition would be sufficient. In IBM’s\nMVS, for example, a file name is an at most 44-character string, largely uninterpreted by system software.\nThe name space is ‘flat,‘ or linear.\n\nSystems designed more recently use names to help organize as well as identify. For instance,\nalthough in MVS the disk containing the file is specified separately from the name, in MS-DOS part of the\n__________________\n† An earlier version of this appeared in Summer 1985 Usenix Conference Proceedings, Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\n\n\n- 2 -\n\nname of a file is a string that identifies the disk drive holding the file. Syntax separates these components\nof the name; MS-DOS uses a colon following the disk name, a single character:\n\nA:FILE\n\nis a file on disk drive A, while\n\nB:FILE\n\nis a file on disk drive B.\n\nThe advantage of putting such information in names is that software need not know about disks to\nmanipulate files. Internally, of course, system software must use the syntax of the name to locate the file,\nbut this is largely transparent to applications software, and users.\n\nThe MVS system uses independent information (stored in a catalog) to find a file given its name,\nwhile MS-DOS exposes location information in the name. MS-DOS users may put related files on the\nsame disk, thus using a distinguished piece of the name to help organize their world. MVS users must\ninstead adapt ad hoc strategies (conventions for the syntax of names) to the same end. Thus each system\ndoes both more and less for the user: MVS provides no help in organization and a naming independent of\nthe physical location of the file, while MS-DOS provides the opposite. Instead, if names had multiple\ncomponents (that is, syntax), where the components did not necessarily correspond to physical devices, the\nname space would have the advantages of that of both MVS and MS-DOS, with the disadvantages of\nneither. Such a name space exists.\n\nA good example: UNIX®\n\nUNIX file name space is a tree, with file names that specify a path from one node to another. The\nrepresentation of the name is a simple ASCII string, with slashes / separating node identifiers. The name\n\n/usr/rob/bin/cat-v\n\nis a path from the root of the tree (denoted by the leading slash), through nodes called usr, rob and bin,\nto a file called cat-v. Nodes intermediate in the tree are called directories. The system uses the compo-\nnents to find the file, which the user can use as syntax to organize sets of files. For example, although on\nmost UNIX systems, the string /usr specifies a separate disk drive, this is irrelevant to both software and\nusers; it is merely a string that identifies the directory beneath which users’ files may be found.\n\nThe structure of the name space (a directory tree) is reflected in the style of the name (a path through\nthe tree). Were the file system arranged differently, say as a flat array, the form and interpretation of file\nnames would also be different; for example, UNIX processes are named by small integers.\n\nProperties of Name Spaces\n\nName spaces have some general properties. First, names within the space may be absolute or rela-\ntive. Absolute names specify an object by position with respect to a single fixed point, such as the root of\nthe UNIX file system (named /); relative names, with respect to a local point (the ‘current working direc-\ntory’ in UNIX, named . (dot)). Also, an operating system typically has operators to manipulate its name\nspace, such as system calls to create and remove files. UNIX also provides a system call (named mount) to\njoin together two name spaces by attaching the root of one space, resident on a separate disk drive, to a leaf\nof another.\n\nFinally, a name space has syntax — how a name is constructed — and semantics — the nature of the\nobject a name identifies.\n\nA UNIX file name, for example, is a sequence of slash-separated strings that identifies a formatless\nbyte stream. External conventions may provide further semantics: the UNIX file system contains objects\nthat are not ordinary files. Simply by having ordinary file names, though, these objects have ordinary file\nproperties such as protection. Some examples from our research version of UNIX, called the Ninth Edition:\n\nDevice files. With names conventionally prefixed (that is, residing in the directory) /dev, these files pro-\nvide direct access to devices. The name /dev/mt, for example, identifies a magnetic tape drive.\n\nProcesses. The directory /proc contains files with names that are process numbers. Opening such a file\n\n\n\n- 3 -\n\nprovides access to processes for purposes such as interactive debugging. Although processes have\nintegers that identify them, it is convenient to provide names for them in the file system as well. For\nexample, listing the directory containing the process files is a simple way to identify running pro-\ncesses.\n\nDatabases. Some databases are conveniently represented as name-value pairs in a hierarchy, and such data-\nbases may be mapped into the file system name space. For example, the directory /n/face con-\ntains a hierarchically-structured database that associates digitized images of people’s faces with the\npeople’s electronic mail addresses.\n\nOther files. UNIX has the notion of standard input: the input connected to a (typically) interactive program.\nThe name /dev/stdin identifies a file that, when opened, connects to the standard input of the\nprogram. This allows files that demand a file name (such as the file comparison program) to be given\ninput directly from the interactive terminal or from a pipe.\n\nBecause these unusual objects have regular names, existing tools can treat them as files, so standard soft-\nware can provide services for them that would otherwise require special handling.\n\nSome of the Ninth Edition examples above have different names in other UNIX systems.\n/dev/stdin is often represented by the single character -, as an argument to commands, but this con-\nvention is capriciously followed. Because it must be provided explicitly by each program, it is only avail-\nable in some programs. By providing /dev/stdin in the global name space, it is available uniformly for\nall programs, always. As another example, processes are represented by an integer process identifier, which\nis only meaningful to a few process-specific system calls. These calls implement their own protection\nmechanism, although the protection provided by the file system suits perfectly (these system calls predate\nthe process file system). Finally, virtual terminals implemented using the multiplexed files of the Seventh\nEdition (an earlier research version of the system) have no external name, so it is impossible to open one for\nI/O. The Ninth Edition provides a name in the file system that is available, without prearrangement or spe-\ncial protocol, to any program.\n\nConnecting Name Spaces\n\nWhen machines are connected together, their name spaces may be joined to facilitate the sharing of\nfiles. If the name spaces have the same clean structure, that structure can be extended simply to describe\nthe larger space. The Newcastle Connection names a file on another machine, say ucbvax, as\n/../ucbvax/usr/rob/bin/cat-v; the Ninth Edition notation is\n/n/ucbvax/usr/rob/bin/cat-v. In the former the name space has been extended by making it a\nsubspace of a larger space, in the latter a new name subspace has been grafted on using mount, but in nei-\nther case has the syntax of names been changed; any program that understands a file name will understand a\nnetwork file name without change, and relative names for files (those that don’t begin with /) are\nunchanged. As a spectacular example, we might see on which machines user wnj has a login by searching\n(using a program called grep) through the system administration files (called /etc/passwd) on all the\nmachines:\n\ngrep wnj /n/*/etc/passwd\n\nThe file name ‘wild card’ character * matches all files within a directory. Here, it happens to match all\nmachines reachable from the local machine, although grep is oblivious of this distinction. We could even\ninvestigate those machines connected to ucbvax by\n\ngrep wnj /n/ucbvax/n/*/etc/passwd\n\nThe file system that is the union of these name spaces might have no global root, so the meaning of\nan absolute name may become ambiguous because of the presence of multiple reference points. In fact,\nthere might be no single point to which all names can be fixed. In practice, though, this ambiguity is unim-\nportant.\n\n\n\n- 4 -\n\nA bad example: VAX/VMS\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone chooses naming conventions in accord with these guidelines. On\nVAX/VMS our canonical file might be called UCBVAX::SYS$DISK:[ROB.BIN]CAT_V.EXE;13.\nThe VMS file naming scheme provides a distinct syntax for each level in the name: UCBVAX:: is a\nmachine; SYS$DISK: is a disk (actually a macro that expands to a disk name such as DUA0:);\n[ROB.BIN] is a directory; CAT_V is a file ‘base’ name; .EXE is a file ‘type’; and ;13 is a version num-\nber.\n\nAlthough this syntax may seem unnecessarily cumbersome, it has a precedent: it is analogous to\nexpressions in programming languages. Consider a C expression such as\n*structure[index].field->ptr. If * were postfix and / the only dereferencing operator, the\nexpression might be written structure/index/field/ptr/. Functionally-minded programmers\nmight use the notation contents(ptr(field(index(structure)))). (A single character can-\nnot be used in C because it could not distinguish X[Y] and X->Y, with X a structure pointer and Y an inte-\nger or structure element respectively, but this ambiguity could be eliminated in a different language.) C and\nVMS use syntax to distinguish the types of the components of a name. Instead, the UNIX file system delib-\nerately hides the distinctions. Aside from the obvious advantages such as simplicity of syntax and the\nusurping of only a single character, the uniformity also makes the name space easier to manipulate: the\nmount system call aliases a disk and a directory.\n\nVMS has no true name space manipulation operator. Although one could be constructed, it would be\nlimited in scope: how could a disk be mounted atop SYS$DISK:[ROB.BIN] when disks are always\nbefore directories in the name? Instead, VMS has macros such as SYS$DISK to hide the manner in which\nthe space is assembled, and even to provide the concept of a local name by automatically inserting an\nexpanded macro before an unqualified name.\n\nThe problems with dynamic evaluation of macros are well known. For example, the VMS service to\nset the reference point for local names (the equivalent of UNIX chdir) sets the default prefix for file\nnames, but the prefix will only be evaluated and so checked for validity, when a file name is interpreted,\nwhich may be arbitrarily and confusingly long after the prefix was set. In fact, the default prefix macro is\nhandled in a special way, because directories are not constructed by simple concatenation; subdirectory\n[.BIN] in directory [ROB] is named [ROB.BIN]. Also, these local names are not really local at all; the\nprefix implicitly binds them to a root of the name space. This implies that all names are always attached to\nsome root, and therefore if the root changes, the name must also change, invisibly.\n\nAnother problem with VMS names is that one cannot do the equivalent of searching the VMS pass-\nword files (SYSUAF.LIS) on various machines with *::SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAF.LIS; the * operator\ndoesn’t apply to that portion of a name. This is an example of the general problem that whenever the name\nsyntax is changed all programs that interpret names must be modified. More subtly, although if the\nmachine ucbvax were a gateway we could access files on a distant machine as\nUCBVAX::KREMVAX::file, it is only because the semantics of :: explicitly permit such access. The\n:: operator is implemented by passing the string after it to the remote machine, but first checking its syn-\ntax, so the file name parser must have special code for multiple ::’s.\n\nA Quibble about Cedar\n\nThe Cedar file system has a uniform naming syntax, just like UNIX, except that files have version\nnumbers, separated from the file name by an exclamation mark !. The implementers thought that version\nnumbers are fundamentally different components of file names and therefore deserved different syntax. But\nthe change in syntax requires new rules to define the meaning of file names. A good test of naming\nschemes is whether arbitrary names constructed by the syntactic rules make sense within the rules of the\nsystem or whether their interpretation requires new semantic rules. In Cedar file,\n/usr/rob/bin/cat-v!3 is clearly version 3 of cat-v, but what is /usr/rob!3/bin/cat-v?\n\n\n\n- 5 -\n\nConnecting to other machine’s file systems\n\nThe IBIS remote file system on UNIX 4.2BSD names a remote file as ucbvax:file. Many pro-\ngrams don’t understand this syntax; the shell (command interpreter) must be modified to make *:file\nbehave as we expect, because the shell expects a slash to separate name components. Worse, by changing\nthe syntax, the implicit semantics of the original naming scheme is lost. In the Ninth Edition name\n/n/ucbvax/file it is obvious what file refers to: a file in the root directory of ucbvax. But what\nis it in ucbvax:file? It might be a file in the root, but it isn’t. It is a file in the initial working directory\non the destination machine (ucbvax) of the user invoking the name on the source machine (unless it\nbegins with /); its meaning depends on who is asking. The extra semantics of : complicate attempts to\npatch the syntactic problems. We might try creating a connection (called a symbolic link in UNIX) from the\nname /n/ucbvax to the name ucbvax:, but /n/ucbvax/file would then still point to a file in\nsomeone’s home directory, and /n/ucbvax/usr/wnj/file would refer to\n/usr/wnj/usr/wnj/file. If the link evaluates to ucbvax:/, things work as expected, but the\nslash-less form of IBIS naming is made unavailable.\n\nPart of the problem in the IBIS file system is that it is implemented outside the name space. By using\na variant of the standard system call mount, the Ninth Edition remote file system guarantees that the syn-\ntax and semantics of names are free of surprises. For example, it is clear what\n/n/ucbvax/n/kremvax/file refers to, but what about the IBIS name ucbvax:kremvax:file?\nWhere does kremvax:file get interpreted?\n\nThere are other ways to interpret file names like ucbvax:file. When using the UNIX program\nuucp to copy a local file to a remote machine, the name ucbvax!file refers to the file on ucbvax\nwhose name is file prefixed by the current directory on the source machine. The prize goes to DECNET,\nhowever: ucbvax::file refers to file in the home directory of the ‘default network user’ on the desti-\nnation machine, and ucbvax\"wnj password\"::file refers to file in wnj’s home directory. It is\ninexcusable that the password is in the file name, let alone that it is in clear text.\n\nThe story so far\n\nIn summary, there are some guidelines for constructing naming conventions, particularly for objects\nin a network. There should be both relative names and absolute names. Relative names are more important\nbecause, among other reasons, the root of the name space may be unknown or non-unique. The syntax\nshould be clean and uniform; every new syntactic rule requires at least one, and usually many, semantic\nrules to resolve peculiarities introduced by the new syntax. If the name space is a tree or any other kind of\ngraph, a single character should be used to separate nodes in a name.\n\nIf these guidelines are followed, names of objects in a network of machines will be easy to construct\nand interpret; difficult problems of networking will be completely hidden to the users and programs access-\ning objects in the network. If they are ignored, both users and programs must be aware of and understand\nthe details of naming locally, globally and everywhere in between.\n\nPrinciples of mail names\n\nNow consider the other common name space, mail names. Mail names are more complex than file\nnames, for both syntactic and semantic reasons. There are conflicting syntactic traditions, the most familiar\ntwo being the UNIX tradition and the ARPANET tradition. Also, mail names are interpreted by user pro-\ngrams only, with no operating system to enforce semantics. Thus, the interpretation of the name space is\nsubject to arbitrary hackery.\n\nEven a trivial case like the name pjw in the command\n\nmail pjw\n\nhas no clear meaning. When electronic mail was invented, the name pjw referred to a mailbox on the local\nmachine — the only machine to which mail could be sent. The local space of mailbox names was a small\nflat space. Later, when systems were connected together, there were two ways to generalize. If the com-\nputers were closely connected (that is, sharing administration), one could extend the flat name space over\nthe whole set of machines, so that saying mail pjw on any of the machines gets pjw’s mailbox on pjw’s\n\n\n\n- 6 -\n\nhome machine. If the machines were instead loosely connected, a more attractive scheme would be to use\nmachine names to qualify the local mailbox names: pjw@system in the ARPANET tradition, or\nsystem!pjw in the UNIX tradition. The two methods differ only in the naming and how the software\ndecides to find the destination. In the first alternative, it looks up pjw in a database, while in the second it\nlooks up system. In both cases, the software on the machines involved must also have a protocol for\ndelivering mail, but that’s irrelevant here. Note that neither naming scheme has anything to do with routing\nthe message.\n\nAt this level, either of these two schemes is fairly convenient. But when we try to connect lots of\nsystems with these flat name spaces, names must either conflict or be decorated artificially to disambiguate\nthem. We should apply the principles of good naming to find a better solution.\n\nMail names specify paths within a large name space populated by systems and mailboxes rather than\nfiles, but the basic idea is the same. The question is what a path denotes. The answer depends on how the\nsoftware determines what to do with the mail.\n\nImagine we are on machine ucbvax and want to send mail to pjw@system. There are two meth-\nods to negotiate the transaction. The first method, used by UNIX, views system as the name of an author-\nity that the mail and mail address are passed to. That is, sending the mail involves a message to system of\nthe form, ‘‘I am machine ucbvax, here is mail for pjw.’’ The second, that of the ARPANET, interprets\nsystem as the name of an authority that will say where to send the mail, as in, ‘‘I am machine ucbvax,\nwhere do I send mail for pjw?’’ The destination of these messages is found by looking up system in a\ndatabase. (The details of sending the message are outside this discussion.) All naming schemes for mail\nfollow some combination of these alternatives. The UNIX method uses the same mechanism to resolve\nnames and to transmit mail; the ARPANET method resolves the names with one mechanism and uses some\nother, not associated with the name at all, to send the mail.\n\nGiven these two models, how do we generalize mail delivery in larger networks? For ARPANET, a\nmail address user@world3.world2.world1 is interpreted by looking up world1 and then asking it\nwhere to send mail for world3.world2. For UNIX, a mail address world1!world2!world3!user\nis interpreted by looking up world1 and then sending the mail and world2!world3!user to it.\nAlthough the two forms sound similar, they have different problems. (And, why does ARPA use two char-\nacters when one is sufficient?)\n\nThe most common interpretation of the UNIX name is as a route, but it need have nothing to do with\na route. Once the name is handed off to world1, it can be rewritten to correspond to the syntax of\nworld1’s name space; in fact, UNIX mailers rewrite names freely. Because ARPANET names are han-\ndled differently, they cannot be rewritten: the answer to the routing question must produce the four-byte\nbinary network address of the destination mailbox. (At least in principle, this defect may be circumvented.\nThe response to the routing question might be a little program: ‘‘Send the mail to A and tell it to use proto-\ncol P to send it to B’’ and so forth. However, that’s not how it’s done in practice.)\n\nConsider again the relation between mail names and file names. When the operating system inter-\nprets the name /n/ucbvax/n/kremvax/file it discovers that the directory /n/ucbvax refers to a\nremote machine, finds the server on that machine, and sends it the name /n/kremvax/file expecting\nback a handle to use the file. It does not care what the server does with the name. It does not expect to get\nback instructions for finding the file. It is asking for file service, not name service. Indeed were ucbvax a\nVMS machine, the server might invisibly translate /n/kremvax/file immediately into\nKREMVAX::SYS$DISK:[NETUSER]file to discover it on its local system. Remote file access would\nbe harder to implement using the ARPANET scheme.\n\nName servers† considered speculative\n\nName servers don’t scale well, for precisely the reason that the ARPANET name scheme doesn’t scale\nwell: the name server must understand all possible name syntaxes. When a system with a different naming\nconvention is connected, the name server must suddenly interpret all the different syntaxes, instead of\n__________________\n† ‘‘Name server’’ is a noun phrase that is ambiguous. You hand a name server a name, it hands you connection informa-\ntion. Thus it serves connections, not names. Consider the difference between air pollution and noise pollution.\n\n\n\n- 7 -\n\nleaving the job to the new system itself. Worse, how do you connect two networks, each with its own name\nserver? Even if the servers use the same data formats and algorithms, they might use unique identifiers that\nbecome non-unique when they are joined.\n\nName servers have problems on other levels, too. Who administers a name server’s database? If the\ndatabase is not audited frequently much of the data will be obsolete, while if the controls are too onerous,\npeople won’t bother keeping the database current. What does the database contain? Most name servers\nproduce network addresses, but no single network reaches everywhere.\n\nWhy are mail names such a mess?\n\nBecause people keep gluing name spaces together without smoothing the syntactic differences. The\nresult is the mail name equivalent of bastardized file names like\n/n/ucbvax/UCBVAX::KREMVAX:/rob/bin/A:dos-file where different conventions are mixed\nin a single string.\n\nRelative names are important\n\nThe ARPANET people define their names to have the form\n\nlocal-part@domain\n\nwhere both local-part and domain are dot-separated lists of words. Domains are the generalization of what\nwe have been calling systems; the local part is anything understood by the leftmost domain name. Accord-\ning to RFC 882 (‘‘Domain Names – Concepts and Facilities’’), the domains are all absolute. The dot signi-\nfying the root of the hierarchy is implicit at the right of the list of names, which makes it impossible to con-\nnect disjoint name spaces since all interpreters of names must know all names at the top level of the hierar-\nchy. Also, for backwards compatibility, RFC 822 (‘‘Standard for the Format of ARPA Internet Text Mes-\nsages’’) allows all but the leftmost of the domain names to be elided, since ‘‘specification of a fully quali-\nfied address can become inconvenient.’’\n\nWhat happens in practice?\n\nAs long as software continues to deliver mail, people are unwilling to improve the state of affairs.\nMailers just butt together names with their own rewriting rules, producing names like:\n\nIJQ3SRA%UCLAMVS.BITNET%SU-LINDY@SU-CSLI.ARPA\n\nThis is the name of user IJQ3SRA on machine UCLAMVS, accessible through BITNET from machine\nSU-LINDY, which is known to SU-CSLI on the ARPANET. Each program that touched this name\nrewrote it by its own rules, although the domains proposal is intended to prevent this.\n\nThere are two domains in this name (although the syntax is wrong): BITNET and ARPA. However,\nBITNET is not a registered name, so the gateway service between BITNET and ARPANET must be made\nexplicit in the name, requiring the invention of a new syntax character (%) which is translated to @ at the\ngateway, because ARPANET names can only contain a single @. Despite the words in the standard about\nhierarchy, the domain space is nearly flat, so the local parts of the names carry source routing and domain\ntransitions explicitly. To worsen matters, machines that advertise adherence to the standard in fact do not;\ninstead the name translations that occur at gateways (such as converting @ to % and rearranging the compo-\nnents) are at best ad hoc. By legislating away bad names, ARPANET has reduced the problem of\nnetworking to a still-unsolved problem. But the mailers plod resolutely on.\n\nStandards?\n\nIt is clear that standards are necessary for electronic mail to be delivered reliably across network\nboundaries. What needs to be standardized is the interpretation of names, especially at network boundaries.\nUntil such a standard exists; is syntactically and semantically clean; distributes the interpretation of names\nacross the systems that understand them; and is adhered to, the network mail situation will not improve.\n\n\n\n- 8 -\n\nConclusions\n\nDoug McIlroy has observed that\n\n... bad notations can stifle progress. Roman numerals hobbled mathematics for a millennium but\nwere propagated by custom and by natural deference to authority. Today we no longer meekly accept\nindividual authority. Instead, we have ‘‘standards,’’ impersonal imprimaturs on convention. Some\nstandards are sound and indispensable; some simply celebrate bureaucratic littleness of mind. A har-\nvest of gimmicks to save appearances within the standard has grown up, then gimmicks to save the\nappearances within the appearances. You know how each one got there: an overnight hack to paste\nanother tumor onto a wild cancerous growth. The concern was with method, regardless of results.\nThe result is extravagantly worse than Roman numerals: you can’t read the notation right to left or\nleft to right. As an amalgam of languages, it can’t be deciphered by a native speaker of any one of\nthem, much as if we were to switch at random places in a number between Roman and Arabic signs\nand between big-endian and little-endian order. But now that it all ‘‘works’’ — at least for the strong\nof stomach — the tumors themselves are being standardized.\n\nI fled, and cry’d out ‘‘Death’’;\nHell trembled at the hideous name, and sigh’d\nFrom all her caves, and back resounded, ‘‘Death.’’\n\n- Milton, Paradise Lost\n\n\n","extracted_metadata":{"access_permission:extract_content":["true"],"dcterms:modified":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"pdf:encrypted":["false"],"pdf:hasMarkedContent":["false"],"xmp:About":["b5b6260c-1643-11e8-0000-0e1a6b6e9242"],"xmp:CreatorTool":["UnknownApplication"],"xmpMM:DocumentID":["b5b6260c-1643-11e8-0000-0e1a6b6e9242"],"pdf:charsPerPage":["2579","3892","3845","4104","4169","4568","3613","1318"],"access_permission:can_print":["true"],"pdf:hasXFA":["false"],"pdf:num3DAnnotations":["0"],"access_permission:modify_annotations":["true"],"pdf:overallPercentageUnmappedUnicodeChars":["0.0"],"pdf:PDFVersion":["1.4"],"access_permission:assemble_document":["true"],"access_permission:can_modify":["true"],"pdf:unmappedUnicodeCharsPerPage":["0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"],"xmpTPg:NPages":["8"],"dcterms:created":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"pdf:hasCollection":["false"],"pdf:producer":["GPL Ghostscript SVN PRE-RELEASE 8.61"],"dc:format":["application/pdf; version=1.4"],"pdf:docinfo:modified":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"dc:title":["Untitled"],"xmp:ModifyDate":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"access_permission:fill_in_form":["true"],"pdf:containsNonEmbeddedFont":["true"],"pdf:hasXMP":["true"],"access_permission:extract_for_accessibility":["true"],"pdf:docinfo:created":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"pdf:containsDamagedFont":["false"],"X-TIKA:Parsed-By-Full-Set":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.pdf.PDFParser"],"Content-Length":["32949"],"access_permission:can_print_degraded":["true"],"Content-Type":["application/pdf"],"resourceName":["The Hideous Name - 1985 (pike85hideous).pdf"],"pdf:docinfo:producer":["GPL Ghostscript SVN PRE-RELEASE 8.61"],"X-TIKA:Parsed-By":["org.apache.tika.parser.DefaultParser","org.apache.tika.parser.pdf.PDFParser"],"xmp:CreateDate":["2008-02-18T13:41:09Z"],"pdf:totalUnmappedUnicodeChars":["0"]},"metadata_field_count":40,"attempts":1,"timestamp":1752386814.373053,"platform":"Linux","python_version":"3.13.5"},{"file_path":"test_documents/pdfs/fake-memo.pdf","file_size":13374,"file_type":"pdf","category":"tiny","framework":"extractous","iteration":2,"extraction_time":0.050705909729003906,"startup_time":null,"peak_memory_mb":770.0,"avg_memory_mb":769.8,"peak_cpu_percent":19.5,"avg_cpu_percent":3.9,"total_io_mb":null,"status":"success","character_count":215,"word_count":37,"error_type":null,"error_message":null,"quality_metrics":{"char_count":215,"word_count":37,"sentence_count":3,"paragraph_count":5,"avg_word_length":4.45945945945946,"avg_sentence_length":12.333333333333334,"extraction_completeness":1.0,"text_coherence":1.0,"noise_ratio":0.0,"gibberish_ratio":0.07407407407407407,"flesch_reading_ease":77.70585585585587,"gunning_fog_index":6.014414414414415,"has_proper_formatting":true,"maintains_line_breaks":true,"preserves_whitespace":false,"table_structure_preserved":false,"format_specific_score":1.0,"expected_content_preserved":false,"has_encoding_issues":false,"has_ocr_artifacts":false,"preserves_pdf_formatting":true},"overall_quality_score":0.72213231981982,"extracted_text":"\nMay 5, 2023\n\n\nTo Whom it May Concern:\n\n\nThere were 20,000 bottles of water, 10,000 blankets, and 200 laptops delivered on January 23, \n2023.

would require re-hashing every key.\n\nA perfect hash function is one that maps the set of actual key values to the table without \nany collisions.\n\nA minimal perfect hash function does so using a

 7         7 reject\n\nu-->2              8         8 reject\n\nu-->3              9         0 reject\n\nu-->4             10         1 ok\n\nSo, if we define g() as determined above, then h() will be a minimal perfect hash \nfunction on the given set of words.\n\nThe primary difficulty is the cost, because the search phase can degenerate to \nexponential performance, and so it is only practical for small sets of words.\n\n\n","extracted_metadata":{"xmp:CreatorTool":["PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2"],"pdf:docinfo:creator_tool":["PScript5.dll Version

years](/wiki/Light_year \"Light year\") (700 [pc](/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\")) from [Earth](/wiki/Earth \"Earth\") in the constellation [Fornax](/wiki/Fornax \"Fornax\").\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\")\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6 \"#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6\") The star is part of the [Helmi stream](/wiki/Helmi_stream \"Helmi stream\"), a former [dwarf galaxy](/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy \"Dwarf galaxy\") that merged with the [Milky Way](/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") between six and nine billion years ago.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") As a result, HIP 13044 circles the [Galactic Center](/wiki/Galactic_Center \"Galactic Center\") at a highly irregular orbit with respect to the [galactic plane](/wiki/Galactic_plane \"Galactic plane\"). HIP 13044 is slightly less massive than the Sun, but is approximately seven times its size. The star, which is estimated to be at least nine billion years old, has passed the [red-giant](/wiki/Red_giant \"Red giant\") phase. The relatively fast rotation of the star may be due to having engulfed one or more planets during the red-giant phase.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")\n\n## Observational history\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Observational history\")\\]\nA science team from the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](/wiki/Max_Planck_Institute_for_Astronomy \"Max Planck Institute for Astronomy\") first observed HIP 13044 using [Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph](/w/index.php?title=Fiber-fed_Extended_Range_Optical_Spectrograph&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (page does not exist)\") (FEROS) at the [European Southern Observatory](/wiki/European_Southern_Observatory \"European Southern Observatory\")'s [La Silla Observatory](/wiki/La_Silla_Observatory \"La Silla Observatory\") in Chile. The first follow-up led to the collection of 36 [radial velocity](/wiki/Radial_velocity \"Radial velocity\") measurements taken between September 2009 and July 2010.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")\n\nThe team also used [photometric](</wiki/Photometry_(astronomy)> \"Photometry (astronomy)\") data that had been passively collected by and publicly released into the archive of the [SuperWASP](/wiki/SuperWASP \"SuperWASP\") collaboration, which had been observing the region where the star was located. In this data, HIP 13044 was found to oscillate; the signal was blocked roughly every sixteen days. Analysis of the SuperWASP and FEROS data led to the supposed discovery of the planet *HIP 13044 b*,\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") although this claim was later refuted.\n\n## Characteristics\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Characteristics\")\\]\nHIP 13044 is an [F-type](/wiki/Stellar_classification#Class_F \"Stellar classification\") star located approximately 701 [parsecs](/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\") (2,286 [light years](/wiki/Light_year \"Light year\")) from Earth in the [Helmi stream](/wiki/Helmi_stream \"Helmi stream\")\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")—a group of low-metallicity stars moving with large velocities relative to the Sun. The star follows an eccentric galactic orbit, with a distance from the galactic center ranging from 7 to 16 [kiloparsecs](/wiki/Kiloparsec \"Kiloparsec\").\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\") The orbit does not lie in the [galactic plane](/wiki/Galactic_plane \"Galactic plane\"), and can reach distances as high as 13 kpc above it. This indicates that it once was part of a satellite galaxy of the [Milky Way](/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") that was disrupted 6–9 billion years ago.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") The star itself is estimated to be at least nine billion years old.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\")\n\nHIP 13044 is fairly evolved star [fusing helium](/wiki/Triple-alpha_process \"Triple-alpha process\") in its core, and has therefore already passed the [red-giant](/wiki/Red_giant \"Red giant\") phase of its evolution.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") It lies near the blue end of the red horizontal branch bordering the [instability strip](/wiki/Instability_strip \"Instability strip\").\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") Its surface temperature is about 6025 K and its radius is approximately 6.7 [solar radii](/wiki/Solar_radius \"Solar radius\"). HIP 13044's mass is estimated to be 0.8 [solar masses](/wiki/Solar_mass \"Solar mass\").\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\") Having a rotation period of 5–6 days, HIP 13044 is a fast-rotating star for its type. It is possible that this is because it has swallowed planets during its red-giant phase.\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6 \"#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6\")\n\nHIP 13044 has an [apparent magnitude](/wiki/Apparent_magnitude \"Apparent magnitude\") of 9.94 and cannot be seen with the unaided eye.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\")\n\n## Claims of a planetary system\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Claims of a planetary system\")\\]\nIn 2010, it was announced that a giant planet in a 16.2-day orbit had been discovered by the radial velocity measurements. This would have had implications for planet formation in metal-poor systems and survival of planets being engulfed by expanded giant stars.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") Subsequent analysis of the data revealed problems with the detection: for example an erroneous barycentric correction had been applied (the same error had also led to claims of planets around [HIP 11952](/wiki/HIP_11952 \"HIP 11952\") that were subsequently refuted). After applying the corrections, there is no evidence for a planet orbiting the star.\\[[9]\\](#cite_note-JonesJenkins2014-9 \"#cite_note-JonesJenkins2014-9\")\n\n## References\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: References\")\\]\n\n1. ^ [***a***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-0 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-0\") [***b***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-1 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-1\") [***c***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-2 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-2\") [***d***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-3 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-3\") [***e***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-4 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-4\") [***f***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-5 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-5\") [Brown, A.

In the verse charm, Sinthgunt is referred to as the sister of the personified sun, [Sunna](</wiki/S%C3%B3l_(Germanic_mythology)> \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\") (whose name is [alliterative](/wiki/Alliterative_verse \"Alliterative verse\") to *Sinthgunt*),\\[[1]\\](#cite_note-ORCHARD112-1 \"#cite_note-ORCHARD112-1\") and the two sisters are cited as both producing incantations to heal the horse of [Phol](/wiki/Phol \"Phol\"), another otherwise unattested figure but possibly the same as [Balder](/wiki/Baldr \"Baldr\"), who is named elsewhere in the charm. The two are then followed by [Friia](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") and [Uolla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\"), also alliterative and stated as sisters.\n\nAs Sinthgunt is otherwise unattested, her significance is otherwise unknown, but some scholarly theories exist about her role in Germanic mythology based on proposed etymologies and the potential significance of her placement within the poem.\n\n## Etymology\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Etymology\")\\]\nThe etymology of *Sinthgunt* is unclear. In the original manuscript, *Sinthgunt* is spelled *Sin**ht**gunt* (emphasis added). In the 19th century, [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\") stuck strictly to this reading, proposing a complex compound based on Germanic *\\*Sin-naχt-gund*, i.e., \"the night-walking one\".\\[[2]\\](#cite_note-2 \"#cite_note-2\") As a result of the pairing with Sunna, the personified sun (corresponding to Old Norse [Sól](</wiki/S%C3%B3l_(Germanic_mythology)> \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\")), this etymology has been interpreted as a reference to the [moon](/wiki/Moon \"Moon\"). However, this reading has yielded problems; the moon in Germanic mythology is considered masculine, exemplified in the personification of the moon in [Norse mythology](/wiki/Norse_mythology \"Norse mythology\"), [Máni](/wiki/M%C3%A1ni \"Máni\"), a male figure. According to [Rudolf Simek](/wiki/Rudolf_Simek \"Rudolf Simek\"), the historical record lacks evidence for any cult of personified celestial bodies among the ancient Germanic peoples.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-3 \"#cite_note-3\")\n\nStefan Schaffner rejects this etymology, as does [Heiner Eichner](/w/index.php?title=Heiner_Eichner&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Heiner Eichner (page does not exist)\") \\[[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiner_Eichner \"de:Heiner Eichner\")\\], because the first element *Sinht-* cannot be based on the presupposed earlier Germanic *\\*sinχt-*. Such a Germanic form would have yielded Old High German *\\*sīht* by regular sound change.\\[[4]\\](#cite_note-4 \"#cite_note-4\") The amended *Sinthgunt* presupposes a Proto-Germanic compound *\\*Senþa-gunþjō*, the first element meaning \"raid, (military) campaign\", the second one \"fight\". This interpretation corresponds well to other Old High German female names such as *Sindhilt* (from *\\*Senþa-χilðijō*, with its second element also meaning \"fight\", cf. [Old Norse](/wiki/Old_Norse \"Old Norse\") *hildr*, [Old English](/wiki/Old_English \"Old English\") *hild*).\\[[5]\\](#cite_note-5 \"#cite_note-5\") Simek also mentions the interpretation \"heavenly body, star\".\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-SIMEK285-286-6 \"#cite_note-SIMEK285-286-6\")\n\n## Placement\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Placement\")\\]\nThe figures [Fulla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\") (*Uolla*) and [Frigg](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") (*Friia*) are attested together in later Old Norse sources (though not as sisters), and theories have been proposed that Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. This notion has resulted in a theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of Sinthgunt and Sunna/Sól, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-BOSTOCK29-7 \"#cite_note-BOSTOCK29-7\") Similarly, [Wolfgang Beck](/w/index.php?title=Wolfgang_Beck&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Wolfgang Beck (page does not exist)\") \\[[de](<https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Beck_(Germanist)> \"de:Wolfgang Beck (Germanist)\")\\] analysed her as a subordinate goddess from Sunna's retinue, a kind of \"situation goddess\", based on her unique appearance in the sources.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-8 \"#cite_note-8\")\n\n[Friedrich Kauffmann](/wiki/Friedrich_Kauffmann \"Friedrich Kauffmann\") classified Sinhtgunt as a [valkyrie](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\") in the 19th century, because the elements *-gund* and *-hild* appear frequently in their names.\\[[9]\\](#cite_note-9 \"#cite_note-9\") Stefan Schaffner and Heiner Eichner more recently agreed with him, based on Günter Müller's paper on the valkyries' healing powers.\\[[10]\\](#cite_note-10 \"#cite_note-10\")\n\n[Karl Helm](/wiki/Karl_Helm \"Karl Helm\") rejected Kauffmann and grouped Sinhtgunt with the [Idisi](/wiki/Idisi \"Idisi\") of the [First Merseburg Charm](/wiki/First_Merseburg_Charm \"First Merseburg Charm\"), as a specially defined group of Germanic goddesses.\\[[11]\\](#cite_note-11 \"#cite_note-11\")\n\n## Notes\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Notes\")\\]\n\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-ORCHARD112_1-0 \"#cite_ref-ORCHARD112_1-0\")** Orchard (1997:112).\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-2 \"#cite_ref-2\")** [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\"). *Studien über die Entstehung der nordischen Götter- und Heldensagen*.
