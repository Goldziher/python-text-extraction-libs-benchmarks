I see I have frightened\nyou--sit down and tell me all the news.\"\n\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna\nScherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With\nthese words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and\nimportance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna\nhad had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la\ngrippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the\nelite.\n\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered\nby a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n\n\"If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the\nprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,\nI shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10--Annette\nScherer.\"\n\n\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the least\ndisconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an\nembroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on\nhis breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that\nrefined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and\nwith the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance\nwho had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna,\nkissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,\nand complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n\n\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's mind\nat rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and\naffected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be\ndiscerned.\n\n\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like\nthese if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You are staying the\nwhole evening, I hope?\"\n\n\"And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I must\nput in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is coming for\nme to take me there.\"\n\n\"I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these\nfestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\n\n\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been\nput off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit\nsaid things he did not even wish to be believed.\n\n\"Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's\ndispatch? You know everything.\"\n\n\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold, listless\ntone. \"What has been decided?

He moved to Huddersfield Town in 1990 where he remained\nfor three seasons before transferring to Leicester City. Roberts signed for Wolverhampton\nWanderers after three further seasons, but stayed for a single campaign before transferring\nto Norwich City, where he spent seven years. He played international football for Wales and\namassed fifteen caps between 1989 and 2001, without scoring.\nRoberts made 647 league appearances during his career, almost half of which were for\nNorwich, where he overcame a weak start to become a fan favourite. At his peak, he scored\n61 goals in three seasons, and finished with two goals in his final game as Norwich achieved\npromotion to the Premiership. He was elected to the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame in\n2002, while still at the club. His professional career ended with spells at Gillingham and on\nloan to Cambridge United.\nSince retiring as a player, Roberts, who speaks fluent Welsh, has worked as a commentator\nfor Sky Sports, BBC Radio Cymru and BBC Cymru Wales. His book, All I Want for\nChristmas ..., a reference to his gap-toothed appearance, prompted both controversy and\npraise when it was published in 2004.\nIwan Wyn Roberts was born in Bangor, Gwynedd, on 26 June 1968,[1] and grew up in\nBarmouth, on the west coast of Wales as a Liverpool fan.[2]\nRoberts says that most football fans would know him (\"if you know me at all\") as \"that gaptoothed ginger lunk\".[3] He started losing his front tooth when he was just 10: his best\nfriend's heel chipping half of his tooth off, the result of an incident playing football.[4] Some\nyears later, a dentist removed the stump when an abscess developed.[4] He lost his second\nfront tooth as the result of an elbow to the mouth from Darran Rowbotham when he was\n18,[5]\n playing for Watford in a pre-season friendly.[4]\nEarly life\n2005 â Cambridge United (loan) 11 (3)\nTotal 647 (202)\nInternational career\n1989â2001 Wales 15 (0)\n1994 Wales B 1 (1)\nManagerial career\n2004 Gillingham (joint-caretaker)\n*Club domestic league appearances and goals\nRoberts credits his school PE teacher, Iolo Owen, as a great influence in his career,\nintroducing him into men's football aged 15: \"He picked me for the school team and got me\ninto the local men's team, Harlech Town ... as he was the manager ... it toughened me up\nand made me a lot stronger.\"[6] Critical to Roberts' thinking when he joined Watford was\nthat coach Tom Walley was, like himself, Welsh-speaking, as was professional Malcolm\nAllen, against whom Roberts had played in the local Welsh leagues.[7] He was also\ninfluenced by Graham Taylor's record of giving youth players opportunities.[8] Roberts\njoined Watford as a trainee, signing his first professional contract in July 1986, shortly after\nhis 18th birthday.[9]\nRoberts made his first-team debut during the 1985â86 season and scored his first goal in professional football on 16 September 1986; it was the\nonly goal in a 1â0 win against Manchester United at Vicarage Road.\n[10] Having made only one full first team appearance for Watford prior to the\nmatch, Roberts came on as a second-half substitute to score the winning goal from a narrow angle.[11] Watford ended the season in ninth\nposition,[12] and despite having three years of his contract remaining, Taylor left the club to join Aston Villa.\n[13] Roberts broke through in the\nfollowing season, making 31 appearances in all competitions and scoring three goals, but Watford finished 19th in the table and were relegated to\nthe Second Division.\n[14][15] The 1988â89 season saw him make 32 appearances in total, scoring six goals,[16] with Watford finishing fourth, but\nfailing to progress past the 1989 Football League play-offs.\n[17] Roberts' chances were restricted the following season, when he made just nine\nleague appearances, scoring twice.[18]\nHe scored nine goals in 63 league matches in total for Watford,[19] but felt that he was failing to get enough opportunities and moved to Division\nThree club Huddersfield Town prior to the start of the 1990â91 season, for Â£275,000.[8][19][20] One of his contemporaries at Watford was future\nNorwich City manager, Glenn Roeder. Roberts remembers Roeder as \"an absolute gentleman ... I can't speak highly enough of him. He helped me\na great deal with his experience and any problems that the young lads had they knew he would help them with.\"[21]\nRoberts credits a lot of his success as a striker to the interaction he had with Huddersfield's then first-team coach, Peter Withe: \"Peter was\nexceptional in the air and he taught me so much on how to use my physicality properly and how to move defenders about especially in the penalty\nbox which would enable me a bit more time and space in the box.\"[22] The club then signed Frank Stapleton, who helped the young Roberts\ndevelop \"awareness in the opposition's penalty box\" and how to \"steal goals\" to increase his goal tally, getting a final touch to 'help' a goalbound\nball cross the line.[22]\nThe 1991â92 season brought Roberts a club post-war record 34 goals in a season, 24 of which were in the league, making him joint top-scorer in\nthe division.[2][8][23] His efforts helped the club to finish third and qualify for the play-offs.\n[24] There they lost to Peterborough United where\nRoberts failed to score in either leg.[8][25] Overall, whilst playing for Huddersfield he scored 50 goals in 142 games.[26][27][28][29]\nIn November\nClub career\nWatford\nHuddersfield Town\n1993 he was signed by the Second Division club Leicester City for Â£300,000.[19][30] Neil Warnock, Huddersfield's manager, needed to sell players\nand Leicester manager Brian Little took an interest.[31]\nRoberts made his debut for Leicester in a Midlands derby against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n[31] At half time, Leicester were two goals behind\nand he expected manager Brian Little, \"the nicest man\" he ever played for to rant in the dressing room, but instead he quietly told the players he\nwas going to make two substitutions.[32]\nIn the second half, Roberts scored two goals to secure a draw.[32] After retiring, Roberts said he still\nregretted not completing a hat-trick in the match, a feat he did achieve in April 1994, in a 28-minute spell against local rivals Derby County.\n[31] As\nrecently as 2017, this achievement is still recalled in a chant by Leicester City fans.[33] Roberts broke some ribs a few weeks later and returned to\nthe first-team squad just in time for the 1993â94 play-off final, which Leicester won 2â1 against Derby.[31]\nIn the 1994â95 Premiership, Leicester struggled and were relegated, but Roberts was the club's top scorer with 11 goals in all competitions.[31][34]\nHe scored another 19 goals the following season, as Leicester reached the play-offs again.[35]\nIn the semi-final, Leicester drew 0-0 with Stoke City\nin the first leg at home and won 1-0 in the second leg from a Garry Parker goal, to qualify for the final.\n[36] What followed was one of the only two\nincidents that \"bugged\" Roberts during his playing career: while celebrating the win, he suddenly realised he was in danger due to a pitch invasion\nby Stoke supporters.[36] He managed to escape, but some of his team-mates, including Neil Lennon and Muzzy Izzet were less fortunate, and had\nto be protected by police.[36][37] Although it was reported that Roberts had recovered from injury,[38] he was not selected for the squad for the\nplay-off final against Crystal Palace. Leicester won the match which secured them promotion to the Premiership.[35] With the side promoted again,\nLeicester decided to sell Roberts to Wolves.[31] In all, Roberts scored 41 goals in 100 league games for Leicester.[19]\nHis goals and performances for Leicester persuaded Wolves to sign Roberts for Â£1.3m in the summer of 1996.[39] He spent only one season at\nMolineux in which he scored 12 goals in 33 games, including one hat-trick for the club in a match against their local rivals West Bromwich Albion\nin the Black Country derby.\n[39][40] Wolves ended the season in third place but lost 4â3 on aggregate to Crystal Palace in the play-offs, with Roberts\nfailing to score in either leg.[41]\nIn the summer off-season of 1997, Roberts returned from holiday and came into the club for the first day of pre-season training where manager\nMark McGhee called him into his office. There McGhee said that he had been told that in order to bring in new players, he had to sell first, and that\nRoberts was the only player for whom an offer had been made â by Norwich City.[42] Roberts did not want to leave the club, but accepted that if\nthe manager did not want him there, he needed to go.[42]\nIn July 1997, Norwich City manager Mike Walker paid Â£850,000 to Wolves to secure the services of Roberts.[43] His time at the club (nicknamed\nthe Canaries) did not begin happily, however. Following his debut in August 1997 against his former club Wolves, he struggled throughout the\n1997â98 season and scored just seven goals; \"there were certainly those in the stands who were questioning whether he was worth the near\nÂ£1,000,000 splashed out on him\".[44] There were crowd chants about him being a \"waste of money\" and Roberts remembers that someone wrote\nLeicester City\nWolverhampton Wanderers\nNorwich City\nto the Eastern Daily Press and described him as \"the worst ever to wear a Norwich shirt\", adding the reflection that \"it was the bleakest period of\nall my years as a pro.\"[42] Roberts had scored just four goals heading into the end of the season; however, his fitness slowly began to improve and\n\"three goals in the final two home games of the season left in good heart for the next campaign\".[44] Walker was sacked at the end of the season,\nand Roberts blames himself for this happening â a result of his lack of goals.[42]\nWalker was replaced during the summer by Bruce Rioch. During pre-season training, Roberts weighed in at 15 stone 3 pounds (97 kg), with a body\nfat ratio of 16â17%, when his \"fighting weight\" should have been \"just under 14 stone with around 13 per cent body fat.\"[45] The turnaround was,\naccording to Roberts, due to some clever psychology by Rioch:\n\"Bruce was very clever: he didn't issue me with an ultimatum, he didn't rant and rave or threaten me. He just said, \"Tom Walley would\nbe proud of you\". Tom was my youth team manager at Watford and absolutely hated people being out of shape ... It was a gentle hint,\nbut I realised ... I had to sort it out myself.\"[45]\nRoberts threw himself into weight training and soon reached a target weight of 13 stone 10 pounds.[45]\nIt paid off: that season, Roberts scored 23\ngoals.[44] He was partnered by what the Eastern Daily Press described as the \"flourishing talent\" of Craig Bellamy who scored 19 goals. Norwich\nfinished in the top half of the table and the Canaries fans voted Roberts player of the season.\n[44]\nIn the 1999â2000 season he was again top scorer\n(19 goals in 49 games) and retained the player of the season award. He just missed out on becoming the first player in the club's history to win the\naward three years in a row when Andy Marshall finished narrowly ahead of him in the voting for the 2000â01 season.\n[46]\nDuring that 1999â2000 campaign there was speculation about Roberts's future as his contract was due to expire in the summer of 2000.[47]\nRoberts had an agent, former team-mate and close friend David Speedie, who advised him to turn down Norwich's offer and sign for Nottingham\nForest or Huddersfield Town. Ultimately, \"he couldn't produce anything on paper that told me I'd be signing ... so I could have got injured in\ntraining, never played again and not got a penny.\"[47] As a result, the two men fell out and Roberts did not use the services of an agent again,\nrepresenting himself in contract negotiations.[47] Shortly after he signed a contract extension in January of that season, Bruce Rioch left the club\nand was succeeded by Bryan Hamilton. Roberts helped Hamilton make a good start when he scored both goals in a 2â0 win at Portman Road\nagainst City's East Anglian derby rivals Ipswich Town on 19 March 2000.[48]\nAlthough Roberts was personally enjoying the most productive spell of his career, his first four years at Carrow Road had seen the club struggle.\nThey had barely threatened to qualify for the end of season play-offs, ending the 2000â01 campaign in 15th place, six points above the relegation\nzone.[49] The 2001â02 season, with new manager Nigel Worthington in his first full season in charge,[50] saw the team fare better and they\nreached the Division One play-off final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.\n[51] Roberts missed much of the second half of the season because of\ninjury, but came off the substitute's bench in the final to give Norwich the lead in the first minute of extra-time with a header. Norwich lost the\nmatch in a penalty shoot-out after Birmingham City had equalised. Roberts took â and scored â the first penalty of the shoot-out but misses by\nPhil Mulryne and Daryl Sutch meant Birmingham won 4â2 and were promoted to the Premiership.[52]\nDuring the 2002â03 season, Roberts captained the Norwich team. That season, in a match against Sheffield Wednesday at Carrow Road, Roberts\nscored twice to move into third place on the list of Norwich City's all-time leading goalscorers, overtaking Robert Fleck in the process.[53] The\nCanaries faded after a good start to the season, finishing in eighth place and failing to qualify for the play-offs.[54] Roberts scored just 7 goals in 47\ngames.[55] The 2003â04 season would be his last at Carrow Road and although he was no longer an regular starter for the first team he played an\nUnder Nigel Worthington,\nRoberts became club\ncaptain, but also finished his\nNorwich City career.\nimportant part in one of the club's best-ever seasons. The team won the title and were promoted to the\nPremiership.[56] Roberts scored some important goals, including the winning strike in a top-of-the-table match\nagainst Sheffield United.\n[57] Roberts revealed in his autobiography that in February of that season he had a cancer\nscare and had to have a malignant melanoma removed from his arm.[58]\nA few days before the club's last home match of the 2003â04 season, Worthington announced that Roberts would not\nbe offered a new contract when his deal expired that summer. Worthington felt that, following promotion to the\nPremiership, the club had to look to the future and that Roberts was now surplus to requirements.[59] Although he\nhad made 41 league appearances that season, he started just 13 games.[60] With the championship already won,\nWorthington restored Roberts to the starting line-up for the last game of the season at Gresty Road against Crewe\nAlexandra and made him captain for the day. Roberts scored twice as City won 3â1;[61] he described the occasion and\nthe goal: \"I'd never scored on the final day of a season before, it was my final game in a Norwich shirt, which was a\nvery sad occasion, Nigel Worthington made me captain for the day and I'll be forever thankful for that, and I managed\nto cap it all off by getting two goals. One of them was a left footed volley into the top corner and I haven't got too\nmany of those in my career!\"[2]\n Overall, Roberts scored 96 goals in 306 games for Norwich.[61]\nAfter being released by Norwich, he received a number of offers to play for other clubs, including from Swiss side FC\nBasel, but eventually signed a two-year contract with Gillingham of the Championship, where he would be\nplayer/coach.[59] His debut was against Ipswich, Norwich's local rivals, and was booked after less than five seconds.[5] The move to Gillingham did\nnot prove a good one for him and he had a number of disagreements with the club, particularly with Stan Ternent after he succeeded Andy\nHessenthaler as manager.[5][62]\nIn December 2004 Roberts had himself served as joint caretaker manager, along with Darren Hare and Paul\nSmith, after the sudden departure of both Hessenthaler and initial caretaker John Gorman.\n[5]\nIn March 2005 he joined Cambridge United on loan\nuntil the end of the season to play under the management of former Norwich team-mate, Rob Newman.\n[2] He scored his 200th league goal on his\ndebut,[5] but Cambridge were relegated from League Two.[63] In August 2005, Roberts retired from playing after reaching an agreement with\nGillingham to pay the final year of his contract.[62]\nWhile a Watford player, Roberts was called up for Wales for the first time, an April 1989 friendly game against Israel.\n[64] He made his debut for the\nWelsh national team on 11 October 1989, when he took to the field in a 2â1 defeat to the Netherlands in a World Cup qualifier at the Racecourse\nGround, Wrexham. With both Ian Rush and Mark Hughes suspended, Roberts started the game alongside Malcolm Allen.[65] He had to wait more\nthan two years for his next international appearance, when his domestic form for Huddersfield saw him leading scorer in Division Two.[23] Roberts\nplayed in a 1â1 friendly against Austria in April 1992.[66] He earned two more caps that year at the Kirin Cup in Japan, suffering a 1â0 loss against\nArgentina and receiving a red card in a 1â0 victory over the host nation for a foul on Masami Ihara.\n[66][67] Roberts made three appearances for the\nsenior Wales team in 1994, including two qualification matches for UEFA Euro 1996 against Albania and Moldova.\n[66] He was not selected for\nWales again until 2000 when he made three appearances in friendlies, all losses against Finland, Brazil and Portugal.\n[66]\nGillingham and Cambridge United\nInternational career\nBellamy playing for Wales\nin 2011\nRoberts made four more appearances for his country in the qualification stages for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in 2000 and 2001.\n[66] He won a total\nof 15 caps for his country over a 12-year period, including a single appearance and one goal for the Wales B team,[68] but failed to score for the\nsenior team.[66] Roberts is phlegmatic that he made only 17 appearances (\"most as substitute\") for Wales, as he \"had to compete against the likes\nof Mark Hughes, Ian Rush, Dean Saunders, so there were some world-class strikers before me and I was just happy to get in the squad.\"[2] He\nregards the fact that he did not score for Wales as the greatest regret of his career.[69]\nStanding at 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m),[1] Roberts was known for scoring a high proportion of his goals with headers.[70] He had\na strong partnership with Craig Bellamy, beginning when Bellamy broke into the Norwich first team in 1997, aged\n18.[71] They also featured together for Wales, although Roberts never managed to score in 15 appearances for the\nnational side. Roberts said \"I absolutely loved playing up-front with [Bellamy] ... we hit it off straight away, probably\nmore so than anyone else I ever played with. It was like telepathy between us.\"[69] He described the relationship as \"the\nclassic big man, little man\" and noted that in their first season together for Norwich, Roberts scored 24 goals and\nBellamy 17.[69]\nIn 2004, Roberts published an account of his last season at Norwich, entitled All I want for Christmas .... The title of\nthe book was a joke based on Roberts' missing front teeth, a reference to the song \"All I Want for Christmas Is My Two\nFront Teeth\".[5] The book proved controversial, because it included an admission of a deliberate stamp on Wolves\ndefender Kevin Muscat, an incident that had taken place in 2000:\n\"As I got up I 'lost my balance' and trod on his back. Fourteen stone through eight studs, you do the maths.\nHe was in agony, but the ref didn't see it so I got away with it. Of course, I pulled him up and said 'Sorry\nmate, sorry mate', but he knew.\"[72]\nRoberts stated in the book that the stamp was a payback for a serious injury that Muscat had inflicted on Craig Bellamy while Bellamy and Roberts\nwere playing together for Norwich, and that Muscat held no grudges over it.[73]\nBecause of the coverage in the book, the Football Association retrospectively investigated the incident and Roberts, then playing at Gillingham,\nwas banned for three matches and fined Â£2,500 for the offence.[74] Roberts commented that this \"left 'a bitter taste' â especially after England\ncaptain David Beckham escaped without a punishment for his deliberate foul in the World Cup qualifier against Wales.\"[75] The Football\nAssociation said there was \"insufficient evidence\" to charge Beckham with bringing the game into disrepute. This was \"despite his admission in\nStyle of play\nAll I Want for Christmas ...\nIwan Roberts appearances, goals and scoring rate\nThe Daily Telegraph and subsequent apology.\"[76] At the time, Roberts told The Daily Telegraph, \"I do not want players to get suspensions and\nfines, but there must be consistency, regardless of who the player is.\"[76] The book was praised by critics. The Daily Telegraph called it \"a rollicking\ngood read. If it doesn't make you at least smile, then it's time to seek counselling.\"[77]\nRoberts has the UEFA A Licence for football coaching and, speaking in 2007, had not ruled out getting into management. He told the Eastern\nDaily Press, \"I've done my qualifications. It's just getting a club to give me a chance and taking it.\"[21] When Norwich sacked Nigel Worthington,\nRoberts applied for the manager's job. \"I tried to go for it ... knowing I wasn't going to get it but I'd never really been for an interview and I thought\nif I did it would stand me in good stead. But I never got a response from the club and that really disappointed me. A week after Peter Grant got the\njob I got a letter through the post saying 'We won't be considering you this time'. And I thought 'I've known that for the past seven days'.\"[21]\nRoberts works in the media. He is bilingual, speaking fluent Welsh, and provides Welsh-language commentary for Sky Sports and BBC Radio\nCymru.\n[78] He also works for BBC Cymru Wales.\n[79] He writes regularly for the local press in Norfolk,[80] commenting on Norwich City and also\ncontributes to the weekly podcast Elis James Feast of Football with comedian Elis James and fellow Welsh former international player Danny\nGabbidon.\n[81]\nRoberts was married in 2016,[82] and has three children; a son and twin\ndaughters.[75]\nIn January 2020, it was reported that Roberts had volunteered for dementia\nresearch.[70]\nIt followed research, published by the University of Glasgow in 2019.[83]\nHe has \"taken a series of simple memory, attention and spatial-awareness tests and\nhe will repeat them every six months\", and will ask former Norwich City colleagues to\ndo the same.[70] As early as in his 2004 autobiography, Roberts had attributed signs\nof memory loss to heading a football: \"I haven't got the best memory ... and I think\nthat comes from heading a football so often, especially in the early days when balls\nwere that bit heavier ... it must have taken its toll.\"[84]\nPost-playing career\nMedia work\nPersonal life\nLegacy\nIn 2002, Roberts was made an inaugural member of the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame.\n[85]\nIn 2007, Roberts came third in a vote run by the\nNorwich Evening News to determine which Norwich legend would be inaugurated into the Professional Footballers' Association Centenary Hall of\nFame.[86]\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition\nClub Season\nLeague FA Cup League Cup Other Total\nDivision Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals\nWatford\n1985â86\n[87] First Division 4 0 0 0 0 0 â 4 0\n1986â87\n[88] First Division 3 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 4 1\n1987â88\n[14] First Division 25 2 1 0 4 1 1\n[a] 0 31 3\n1988â89\n[16] Second Division 22 6 5 0 1 0 4\n[b] 0 32 6\n1989â90\n[18] Second Division 9 0 1 0 2 2 0 0 12 2\nTotal 63 9 7 0 8 3 5 0 83 12\nHuddersfield Town\n1990â91\n[26] Third Division 44 13 2 1 2 0 2\n[c] 0 50 14\n1991â92\n[27] Third Division 46 24 3 3 5 3 7\n[d] 4 61 34\n1992â93\n[28] Second Division 37 9 5 0 4 2 5\n[c] 4 51 15\n1993â94\n[29] Second Division 15 4 2 0 3 1 1\n[c] 0 21 5\nTotal 142 50 12 4 14 6 15 8 183 68\nLeicester City\n1993â94\n[89] First Division 26 13 â â 1\n[e] 0 27 13\n1994â95\n[34] Premiership 37 9 3 2 2 0 â 42 11\n1995â96\n[90] First Division 37 19 2 0 3 1 0 0 42 20\nTotal 100 41 5 2 5 1 1 0 111 44\nWolverhampton Wanderers 1996â97\n[40] First Division 33 12 1 0 2 0 2\n[e] 0 38 12\nNorwich City 1997â98\n[91] First Division 31 5 0 0 2 2 â 33 7\n1998â99\n[92] First Division 45 19 1 1 5 3 â 51 23\n1999â2000\n[93] First Division 44 17 1 0 4 2 â 49 19\nCareer statistics\nClub\n2000â01\n[94] First Division 44 15 1 1 5 3 â 50 19\n2001â02\n[95] First Division 30 13 0 0 1 0 3\n[e] 1 34 14\n2002â03\n[55] First Division 43 7 3 0 1 0 â 47 7\n2003â04\n[60] First Division 41 8 1 0 0 0 â 42 8\nTotal 278 84 7 2 18 10 3 1 306 97\nGillingham 2004â05\n[96] Championship 20 3 1 0 1 0 â 22 3\nCambridge United (loan) 2004â05\n[96] League Two 11 3 â â â 11 3\nCareer total 647 202 33 8 48 20 26 9 754 239\na.

In the verse charm, Sinthgunt is referred to as the sister of the personified sun, [Sunna](/wiki/S%C3%B3l_%28Germanic_mythology%29 \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\") (whose name is [alliterative](/wiki/Alliterative_verse \"Alliterative verse\") to *Sinthgunt*),[[1]](#cite_note-ORCHARD112-1) and the two sisters are cited as both producing incantations to heal the horse of [Phol](/wiki/Phol \"Phol\"), another otherwise unattested figure but possibly the same as [Balder](/wiki/Baldr \"Baldr\"), who is named elsewhere in the charm. The two are then followed by [Friia](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") and [Uolla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\"), also alliterative and stated as sisters.\n\nAs Sinthgunt is otherwise unattested, her significance is otherwise unknown, but some scholarly theories exist about her role in Germanic mythology based on proposed etymologies and the potential significance of her placement within the poem.\n\n## Etymology\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Etymology\")]\n\nThe etymology of *Sinthgunt* is unclear. In the original manuscript, *Sinthgunt* is spelled *Sin**ht**gunt* (emphasis added). In the 19th century, [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\") stuck strictly to this reading, proposing a complex compound based on Germanic *\\*Sin-naχt-gund*, i.e., \"the night-walking one\".[[2]](#cite_note-2) As a result of the pairing with Sunna, the personified sun (corresponding to Old Norse [Sól](/wiki/S%C3%B3l_%28Germanic_mythology%29 \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\")), this etymology has been interpreted as a reference to the [moon](/wiki/Moon \"Moon\"). However, this reading has yielded problems; the moon in Germanic mythology is considered masculine, exemplified in the personification of the moon in [Norse mythology](/wiki/Norse_mythology \"Norse mythology\"), [Máni](/wiki/M%C3%A1ni \"Máni\"), a male figure. According to [Rudolf Simek](/wiki/Rudolf_Simek \"Rudolf Simek\"), the historical record lacks evidence for any cult of personified celestial bodies among the ancient Germanic peoples.[[3]](#cite_note-3)\n\nStefan Schaffner rejects this etymology, as does [Heiner Eichner](/w/index.php?title=Heiner_Eichner&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Heiner Eichner (page does not exist)\") [[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiner_Eichner \"de:Heiner Eichner\")], because the first element *Sinht-* cannot be based on the presupposed earlier Germanic *\\*sinχt-*. Such a Germanic form would have yielded Old High German *\\*sīht* by regular sound change.[[4]](#cite_note-4) The amended *Sinthgunt* presupposes a Proto-Germanic compound *\\*Senþa-gunþjō*, the first element meaning \"raid, (military) campaign\", the second one \"fight\". This interpretation corresponds well to other Old High German female names such as *Sindhilt* (from *\\*Senþa-χilðijō*, with its second element also meaning \"fight\", cf. [Old Norse](/wiki/Old_Norse \"Old Norse\") *hildr*, [Old English](/wiki/Old_English \"Old English\") *hild*).[[5]](#cite_note-5) Simek also mentions the interpretation \"heavenly body, star\".[[6]](#cite_note-SIMEK285-286-6)\n\n## Placement\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Placement\")]\n\nThe figures [Fulla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\") (*Uolla*) and [Frigg](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") (*Friia*) are attested together in later Old Norse sources (though not as sisters), and theories have been proposed that Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. This notion has resulted in a theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of Sinthgunt and Sunna/Sól, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.[[7]](#cite_note-BOSTOCK29-7) Similarly, [Wolfgang Beck](/w/index.php?title=Wolfgang_Beck&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Wolfgang Beck (page does not exist)\") [[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Beck_%28Germanist%29 \"de:Wolfgang Beck (Germanist)\")] analysed her as a subordinate goddess from Sunna's retinue, a kind of \"situation goddess\", based on her unique appearance in the sources.[[8]](#cite_note-8)\n\n[Friedrich Kauffmann](/wiki/Friedrich_Kauffmann \"Friedrich Kauffmann\") classified Sinhtgunt as a [valkyrie](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\") in the 19th century, because the elements *-gund* and *-hild* appear frequently in their names.[[9]](#cite_note-9) Stefan Schaffner and Heiner Eichner more recently agreed with him, based on Günter Müller's paper on the valkyries' healing powers.[[10]](#cite_note-10)\n\n[Karl Helm](/wiki/Karl_Helm \"Karl Helm\") rejected Kauffmann and grouped Sinhtgunt with the [Idisi](/wiki/Idisi \"Idisi\") of the [First Merseburg Charm](/wiki/First_Merseburg_Charm \"First Merseburg Charm\"), as a specially defined group of Germanic goddesses.[[11]](#cite_note-11)\n\n## Notes\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-ORCHARD112_1-0)** Orchard (1997:112).\n2. **[^](#cite_ref-2)** [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\"). *Studien über die Entstehung der nordischen Götter- und Heldensagen*.

years](/wiki/Light_year \"Light year\") (700 [pc](/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\")) from [Earth](/wiki/Earth \"Earth\") in the constellation [Fornax](/wiki/Fornax \"Fornax\").\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\")\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6 \"#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6\") The star is part of the [Helmi stream](/wiki/Helmi_stream \"Helmi stream\"), a former [dwarf galaxy](/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy \"Dwarf galaxy\") that merged with the [Milky Way](/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") between six and nine billion years ago.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") As a result, HIP 13044 circles the [Galactic Center](/wiki/Galactic_Center \"Galactic Center\") at a highly irregular orbit with respect to the [galactic plane](/wiki/Galactic_plane \"Galactic plane\"). HIP 13044 is slightly less massive than the Sun, but is approximately seven times its size. The star, which is estimated to be at least nine billion years old, has passed the [red-giant](/wiki/Red_giant \"Red giant\") phase. The relatively fast rotation of the star may be due to having engulfed one or more planets during the red-giant phase.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")\n\n## Observational history\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Observational history\")\\]\nA science team from the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](/wiki/Max_Planck_Institute_for_Astronomy \"Max Planck Institute for Astronomy\") first observed HIP 13044 using [Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph](/w/index.php?title=Fiber-fed_Extended_Range_Optical_Spectrograph&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (page does not exist)\") (FEROS) at the [European Southern Observatory](/wiki/European_Southern_Observatory \"European Southern Observatory\")'s [La Silla Observatory](/wiki/La_Silla_Observatory \"La Silla Observatory\") in Chile. The first follow-up led to the collection of 36 [radial velocity](/wiki/Radial_velocity \"Radial velocity\") measurements taken between September 2009 and July 2010.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")\n\nThe team also used [photometric](</wiki/Photometry_(astronomy)> \"Photometry (astronomy)\") data that had been passively collected by and publicly released into the archive of the [SuperWASP](/wiki/SuperWASP \"SuperWASP\") collaboration, which had been observing the region where the star was located. In this data, HIP 13044 was found to oscillate; the signal was blocked roughly every sixteen days. Analysis of the SuperWASP and FEROS data led to the supposed discovery of the planet *HIP 13044 b*,\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") although this claim was later refuted.\n\n## Characteristics\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Characteristics\")\\]\nHIP 13044 is an [F-type](/wiki/Stellar_classification#Class_F \"Stellar classification\") star located approximately 701 [parsecs](/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\") (2,286 [light years](/wiki/Light_year \"Light year\")) from Earth in the [Helmi stream](/wiki/Helmi_stream \"Helmi stream\")\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")—a group of low-metallicity stars moving with large velocities relative to the Sun. The star follows an eccentric galactic orbit, with a distance from the galactic center ranging from 7 to 16 [kiloparsecs](/wiki/Kiloparsec \"Kiloparsec\").\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\") The orbit does not lie in the [galactic plane](/wiki/Galactic_plane \"Galactic plane\"), and can reach distances as high as 13 kpc above it. This indicates that it once was part of a satellite galaxy of the [Milky Way](/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") that was disrupted 6–9 billion years ago.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") The star itself is estimated to be at least nine billion years old.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\")\n\nHIP 13044 is fairly evolved star [fusing helium](/wiki/Triple-alpha_process \"Triple-alpha process\") in its core, and has therefore already passed the [red-giant](/wiki/Red_giant \"Red giant\") phase of its evolution.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") It lies near the blue end of the red horizontal branch bordering the [instability strip](/wiki/Instability_strip \"Instability strip\").\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") Its surface temperature is about 6025 K and its radius is approximately 6.7 [solar radii](/wiki/Solar_radius \"Solar radius\"). HIP 13044's mass is estimated to be 0.8 [solar masses](/wiki/Solar_mass \"Solar mass\").\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\") Having a rotation period of 5–6 days, HIP 13044 is a fast-rotating star for its type. It is possible that this is because it has swallowed planets during its red-giant phase.\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6 \"#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6\")\n\nHIP 13044 has an [apparent magnitude](/wiki/Apparent_magnitude \"Apparent magnitude\") of 9.94 and cannot be seen with the unaided eye.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\")\n\n## Claims of a planetary system\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Claims of a planetary system\")\\]\nIn 2010, it was announced that a giant planet in a 16.2-day orbit had been discovered by the radial velocity measurements. This would have had implications for planet formation in metal-poor systems and survival of planets being engulfed by expanded giant stars.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") Subsequent analysis of the data revealed problems with the detection: for example an erroneous barycentric correction had been applied (the same error had also led to claims of planets around [HIP 11952](/wiki/HIP_11952 \"HIP 11952\") that were subsequently refuted). After applying the corrections, there is no evidence for a planet orbiting the star.\\[[9]\\](#cite_note-JonesJenkins2014-9 \"#cite_note-JonesJenkins2014-9\")\n\n## References\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: References\")\\]\n\n1. ^ [***a***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-0 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-0\") [***b***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-1 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-1\") [***c***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-2 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-2\") [***d***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-3 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-3\") [***e***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-4 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-4\") [***f***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-5 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-5\") [Brown, A.

In the verse charm, Sinthgunt is referred to as the sister of the personified sun, [Sunna](</wiki/S%C3%B3l_(Germanic_mythology)> \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\") (whose name is [alliterative](/wiki/Alliterative_verse \"Alliterative verse\") to *Sinthgunt*),\\[[1]\\](#cite_note-ORCHARD112-1 \"#cite_note-ORCHARD112-1\") and the two sisters are cited as both producing incantations to heal the horse of [Phol](/wiki/Phol \"Phol\"), another otherwise unattested figure but possibly the same as [Balder](/wiki/Baldr \"Baldr\"), who is named elsewhere in the charm. The two are then followed by [Friia](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") and [Uolla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\"), also alliterative and stated as sisters.\n\nAs Sinthgunt is otherwise unattested, her significance is otherwise unknown, but some scholarly theories exist about her role in Germanic mythology based on proposed etymologies and the potential significance of her placement within the poem.\n\n## Etymology\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Etymology\")\\]\nThe etymology of *Sinthgunt* is unclear. In the original manuscript, *Sinthgunt* is spelled *Sin**ht**gunt* (emphasis added). In the 19th century, [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\") stuck strictly to this reading, proposing a complex compound based on Germanic *\\*Sin-naχt-gund*, i.e., \"the night-walking one\".\\[[2]\\](#cite_note-2 \"#cite_note-2\") As a result of the pairing with Sunna, the personified sun (corresponding to Old Norse [Sól](</wiki/S%C3%B3l_(Germanic_mythology)> \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\")), this etymology has been interpreted as a reference to the [moon](/wiki/Moon \"Moon\"). However, this reading has yielded problems; the moon in Germanic mythology is considered masculine, exemplified in the personification of the moon in [Norse mythology](/wiki/Norse_mythology \"Norse mythology\"), [Máni](/wiki/M%C3%A1ni \"Máni\"), a male figure. According to [Rudolf Simek](/wiki/Rudolf_Simek \"Rudolf Simek\"), the historical record lacks evidence for any cult of personified celestial bodies among the ancient Germanic peoples.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-3 \"#cite_note-3\")\n\nStefan Schaffner rejects this etymology, as does [Heiner Eichner](/w/index.php?title=Heiner_Eichner&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Heiner Eichner (page does not exist)\") \\[[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiner_Eichner \"de:Heiner Eichner\")\\], because the first element *Sinht-* cannot be based on the presupposed earlier Germanic *\\*sinχt-*. Such a Germanic form would have yielded Old High German *\\*sīht* by regular sound change.\\[[4]\\](#cite_note-4 \"#cite_note-4\") The amended *Sinthgunt* presupposes a Proto-Germanic compound *\\*Senþa-gunþjō*, the first element meaning \"raid, (military) campaign\", the second one \"fight\". This interpretation corresponds well to other Old High German female names such as *Sindhilt* (from *\\*Senþa-χilðijō*, with its second element also meaning \"fight\", cf. [Old Norse](/wiki/Old_Norse \"Old Norse\") *hildr*, [Old English](/wiki/Old_English \"Old English\") *hild*).\\[[5]\\](#cite_note-5 \"#cite_note-5\") Simek also mentions the interpretation \"heavenly body, star\".\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-SIMEK285-286-6 \"#cite_note-SIMEK285-286-6\")\n\n## Placement\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Placement\")\\]\nThe figures [Fulla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\") (*Uolla*) and [Frigg](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") (*Friia*) are attested together in later Old Norse sources (though not as sisters), and theories have been proposed that Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. This notion has resulted in a theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of Sinthgunt and Sunna/Sól, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-BOSTOCK29-7 \"#cite_note-BOSTOCK29-7\") Similarly, [Wolfgang Beck](/w/index.php?title=Wolfgang_Beck&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Wolfgang Beck (page does not exist)\") \\[[de](<https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Beck_(Germanist)> \"de:Wolfgang Beck (Germanist)\")\\] analysed her as a subordinate goddess from Sunna's retinue, a kind of \"situation goddess\", based on her unique appearance in the sources.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-8 \"#cite_note-8\")\n\n[Friedrich Kauffmann](/wiki/Friedrich_Kauffmann \"Friedrich Kauffmann\") classified Sinhtgunt as a [valkyrie](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\") in the 19th century, because the elements *-gund* and *-hild* appear frequently in their names.\\[[9]\\](#cite_note-9 \"#cite_note-9\") Stefan Schaffner and Heiner Eichner more recently agreed with him, based on Günter Müller's paper on the valkyries' healing powers.\\[[10]\\](#cite_note-10 \"#cite_note-10\")\n\n[Karl Helm](/wiki/Karl_Helm \"Karl Helm\") rejected Kauffmann and grouped Sinhtgunt with the [Idisi](/wiki/Idisi \"Idisi\") of the [First Merseburg Charm](/wiki/First_Merseburg_Charm \"First Merseburg Charm\"), as a specially defined group of Germanic goddesses.\\[[11]\\](#cite_note-11 \"#cite_note-11\")\n\n## Notes\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Notes\")\\]\n\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-ORCHARD112_1-0 \"#cite_ref-ORCHARD112_1-0\")** Orchard (1997:112).\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-2 \"#cite_ref-2\")** [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\"). *Studien über die Entstehung der nordischen Götter- und Heldensagen*.

But how do you do? I see I have frightened\nyou--sit down and tell me all the news.\"\n\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna\nScherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With\nthese words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and\nimportance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna\nhad had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la\ngrippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the\nelite.\n\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered\nby a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n\n\"If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the\nprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,\nI shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10--Annette\nScherer.\"\n\n\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the least\ndisconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an\nembroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on\nhis breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that\nrefined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and\nwith the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance\nwho had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna,\nkissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,\nand complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n\n\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's mind\nat rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and\naffected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be\ndiscerned.\n\n\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like\nthese if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You are staying the\nwhole evening, I hope?\"\n\n\"And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I must\nput in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is coming for\nme to take me there.\"\n\n\"I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these\nfestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\n\n\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been\nput off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit\nsaid things he did not even wish to be believed.\n\n\"Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's\ndispatch? You know everything.\"\n\n\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold, listless\ntone. \"What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has\nburnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.\"\n","extracted_metadata":{},"metadata_field_count":null,"attempts":1,"timestamp":1754064525.2972472,"platform":"Linux","python_version":"3.13.5"},{"file_path":"test_documents/text/selected_pdfs.txt","file_size":2374,"file_type":"txt","category":"tiny","framework":"markitdown","iteration":1,"extraction_time":0.007287502288818359,"startup_time":null,"peak_memory_mb":241.1015625,"avg_memory_mb":241.1015625,"peak_cpu_percent":395.7,"avg_cpu_percent":195.38,"total_io_mb":null,"status":"success","character_count":2374,"word_count":337,"error_type":null,"error_message":null,"quality_metrics":{"char_count":2374,"word_count":337,"sentence_count":46,"paragraph_count":6,"avg_word_length":6.029673590504451,"avg_sentence_length":7.913043478260869,"extraction_completeness":1.0,"text_coherence":0.8260869565217391,"noise_ratio":0.0,"gibberish_ratio":0.13924050632911392,"flesch_reading_ease":31.25250179629964,"gunning_fog_index":13.869193461469374,"has_proper_formatting":true,"maintains_line_breaks":true,"preserves_whitespace":false,"table_structure_preserved":false,"format_specific_score":0.0,"expected_content_preserved":false},"overall_quality_score":0.43308736637580936,"extracted_text":"# Selected PDFs for Benchmarking\n\n## Small PDFs (< 100KB)\n1.

He moved to Huddersfield Town in 1990 where he remained\nfor three seasons before transferring to Leicester City. Roberts signed for Wolverhampton\nWanderers after three further seasons, but stayed for a single campaign before transferring\nto Norwich City, where he spent seven years. He played international football for Wales and\namassed fifteen caps between 1989 and 2001, without scoring.\nRoberts made 647 league appearances during his career, almost half of which were for\nNorwich, where he overcame a weak start to become a fan favourite. At his peak, he scored\n61 goals in three seasons, and finished with two goals in his final game as Norwich achieved\npromotion to the Premiership. He was elected to the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame in\n2002, while still at the club. His professional career ended with spells at Gillingham and on\nloan to Cambridge United.\nSince retiring as a player, Roberts, who speaks fluent Welsh, has worked as a commentator\nfor Sky Sports, BBC Radio Cymru and BBC Cymru Wales. His book, All I Want for\nChristmas ..., a reference to his gap-toothed appearance, prompted both controversy and\npraise when it was published in 2004.\nIwan Wyn Roberts was born in Bangor, Gwynedd, on 26 June 1968,[1] and grew up in\nBarmouth, on the west coast of Wales as a Liverpool fan.[2]\nRoberts says that most football fans would know him (\"if you know me at all\") as \"that gaptoothed ginger lunk\".[3] He started losing his front tooth when he was just 10: his best\nfriend's heel chipping half of his tooth off, the result of an incident playing football.[4] Some\nyears later, a dentist removed the stump when an abscess developed.[4] He lost his second\nfront tooth as the result of an elbow to the mouth from Darran Rowbotham when he was\n18,[5]\n playing for Watford in a pre-season friendly.[4]\nEarly life\n2005 â Cambridge United (loan) 11 (3)\nTotal 647 (202)\nInternational career\n1989â2001 Wales 15 (0)\n1994 Wales B 1 (1)\nManagerial career\n2004 Gillingham (joint-caretaker)\n*Club domestic league appearances and goals\nRoberts credits his school PE teacher, Iolo Owen, as a great influence in his career,\nintroducing him into men's football aged 15: \"He picked me for the school team and got me\ninto the local men's team, Harlech Town ... as he was the manager ... it toughened me up\nand made me a lot stronger.\"[6] Critical to Roberts' thinking when he joined Watford was\nthat coach Tom Walley was, like himself, Welsh-speaking, as was professional Malcolm\nAllen, against whom Roberts had played in the local Welsh leagues.[7] He was also\ninfluenced by Graham Taylor's record of giving youth players opportunities.[8] Roberts\njoined Watford as a trainee, signing his first professional contract in July 1986, shortly after\nhis 18th birthday.[9]\nRoberts made his first-team debut during the 1985â86 season and scored his first goal in professional football on 16 September 1986; it was the\nonly goal in a 1â0 win against Manchester United at Vicarage Road.\n[10] Having made only one full first team appearance for Watford prior to the\nmatch, Roberts came on as a second-half substitute to score the winning goal from a narrow angle.[11] Watford ended the season in ninth\nposition,[12] and despite having three years of his contract remaining, Taylor left the club to join Aston Villa.\n[13] Roberts broke through in the\nfollowing season, making 31 appearances in all competitions and scoring three goals, but Watford finished 19th in the table and were relegated to\nthe Second Division.\n[14][15] The 1988â89 season saw him make 32 appearances in total, scoring six goals,[16] with Watford finishing fourth, but\nfailing to progress past the 1989 Football League play-offs.\n[17] Roberts' chances were restricted the following season, when he made just nine\nleague appearances, scoring twice.[18]\nHe scored nine goals in 63 league matches in total for Watford,[19] but felt that he was failing to get enough opportunities and moved to Division\nThree club Huddersfield Town prior to the start of the 1990â91 season, for Â£275,000.[8][19][20] One of his contemporaries at Watford was future\nNorwich City manager, Glenn Roeder. Roberts remembers Roeder as \"an absolute gentleman ... I can't speak highly enough of him. He helped me\na great deal with his experience and any problems that the young lads had they knew he would help them with.\"[21]\nRoberts credits a lot of his success as a striker to the interaction he had with Huddersfield's then first-team coach, Peter Withe: \"Peter was\nexceptional in the air and he taught me so much on how to use my physicality properly and how to move defenders about especially in the penalty\nbox which would enable me a bit more time and space in the box.\"[22] The club then signed Frank Stapleton, who helped the young Roberts\ndevelop \"awareness in the opposition's penalty box\" and how to \"steal goals\" to increase his goal tally, getting a final touch to 'help' a goalbound\nball cross the line.[22]\nThe 1991â92 season brought Roberts a club post-war record 34 goals in a season, 24 of which were in the league, making him joint top-scorer in\nthe division.[2][8][23] His efforts helped the club to finish third and qualify for the play-offs.\n[24] There they lost to Peterborough United where\nRoberts failed to score in either leg.[8][25] Overall, whilst playing for Huddersfield he scored 50 goals in 142 games.[26][27][28][29]\nIn November\nClub career\nWatford\nHuddersfield Town\n1993 he was signed by the Second Division club Leicester City for Â£300,000.[19][30] Neil Warnock, Huddersfield's manager, needed to sell players\nand Leicester manager Brian Little took an interest.[31]\nRoberts made his debut for Leicester in a Midlands derby against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n[31] At half time, Leicester were two goals behind\nand he expected manager Brian Little, \"the nicest man\" he ever played for to rant in the dressing room, but instead he quietly told the players he\nwas going to make two substitutions.[32]\nIn the second half, Roberts scored two goals to secure a draw.[32] After retiring, Roberts said he still\nregretted not completing a hat-trick in the match, a feat he did achieve in April 1994, in a 28-minute spell against local rivals Derby County.\n[31] As\nrecently as 2017, this achievement is still recalled in a chant by Leicester City fans.[33] Roberts broke some ribs a few weeks later and returned to\nthe first-team squad just in time for the 1993â94 play-off final, which Leicester won 2â1 against Derby.[31]\nIn the 1994â95 Premiership, Leicester struggled and were relegated, but Roberts was the club's top scorer with 11 goals in all competitions.[31][34]\nHe scored another 19 goals the following season, as Leicester reached the play-offs again.[35]\nIn the semi-final, Leicester drew 0-0 with Stoke City\nin the first leg at home and won 1-0 in the second leg from a Garry Parker goal, to qualify for the final.\n[36] What followed was one of the only two\nincidents that \"bugged\" Roberts during his playing career: while celebrating the win, he suddenly realised he was in danger due to a pitch invasion\nby Stoke supporters.[36] He managed to escape, but some of his team-mates, including Neil Lennon and Muzzy Izzet were less fortunate, and had\nto be protected by police.[36][37] Although it was reported that Roberts had recovered from injury,[38] he was not selected for the squad for the\nplay-off final against Crystal Palace. Leicester won the match which secured them promotion to the Premiership.[35] With the side promoted again,\nLeicester decided to sell Roberts to Wolves.[31] In all, Roberts scored 41 goals in 100 league games for Leicester.[19]\nHis goals and performances for Leicester persuaded Wolves to sign Roberts for Â£1.3m in the summer of 1996.[39] He spent only one season at\nMolineux in which he scored 12 goals in 33 games, including one hat-trick for the club in a match against their local rivals West Bromwich Albion\nin the Black Country derby.\n[39][40] Wolves ended the season in third place but lost 4â3 on aggregate to Crystal Palace in the play-offs, with Roberts\nfailing to score in either leg.[41]\nIn the summer off-season of 1997, Roberts returned from holiday and came into the club for the first day of pre-season training where manager\nMark McGhee called him into his office. There McGhee said that he had been told that in order to bring in new players, he had to sell first, and that\nRoberts was the only player for whom an offer had been made â by Norwich City.[42] Roberts did not want to leave the club, but accepted that if\nthe manager did not want him there, he needed to go.[42]\nIn July 1997, Norwich City manager Mike Walker paid Â£850,000 to Wolves to secure the services of Roberts.[43] His time at the club (nicknamed\nthe Canaries) did not begin happily, however. Following his debut in August 1997 against his former club Wolves, he struggled throughout the\n1997â98 season and scored just seven goals; \"there were certainly those in the stands who were questioning whether he was worth the near\nÂ£1,000,000 splashed out on him\".[44] There were crowd chants about him being a \"waste of money\" and Roberts remembers that someone wrote\nLeicester City\nWolverhampton Wanderers\nNorwich City\nto the Eastern Daily Press and described him as \"the worst ever to wear a Norwich shirt\", adding the reflection that \"it was the bleakest period of\nall my years as a pro.\"[42] Roberts had scored just four goals heading into the end of the season; however, his fitness slowly began to improve and\n\"three goals in the final two home games of the season left in good heart for the next campaign\".[44] Walker was sacked at the end of the season,\nand Roberts blames himself for this happening â a result of his lack of goals.[42]\nWalker was replaced during the summer by Bruce Rioch. During pre-season training, Roberts weighed in at 15 stone 3 pounds (97 kg), with a body\nfat ratio of 16â17%, when his \"fighting weight\" should have been \"just under 14 stone with around 13 per cent body fat.\"[45] The turnaround was,\naccording to Roberts, due to some clever psychology by Rioch:\n\"Bruce was very clever: he didn't issue me with an ultimatum, he didn't rant and rave or threaten me. He just said, \"Tom Walley would\nbe proud of you\". Tom was my youth team manager at Watford and absolutely hated people being out of shape ... It was a gentle hint,\nbut I realised ... I had to sort it out myself.\"[45]\nRoberts threw himself into weight training and soon reached a target weight of 13 stone 10 pounds.[45]\nIt paid off: that season, Roberts scored 23\ngoals.[44] He was partnered by what the Eastern Daily Press described as the \"flourishing talent\" of Craig Bellamy who scored 19 goals. Norwich\nfinished in the top half of the table and the Canaries fans voted Roberts player of the season.\n[44]\nIn the 1999â2000 season he was again top scorer\n(19 goals in 49 games) and retained the player of the season award. He just missed out on becoming the first player in the club's history to win the\naward three years in a row when Andy Marshall finished narrowly ahead of him in the voting for the 2000â01 season.\n[46]\nDuring that 1999â2000 campaign there was speculation about Roberts's future as his contract was due to expire in the summer of 2000.[47]\nRoberts had an agent, former team-mate and close friend David Speedie, who advised him to turn down Norwich's offer and sign for Nottingham\nForest or Huddersfield Town. Ultimately, \"he couldn't produce anything on paper that told me I'd be signing ... so I could have got injured in\ntraining, never played again and not got a penny.\"[47] As a result, the two men fell out and Roberts did not use the services of an agent again,\nrepresenting himself in contract negotiations.[47] Shortly after he signed a contract extension in January of that season, Bruce Rioch left the club\nand was succeeded by Bryan Hamilton. Roberts helped Hamilton make a good start when he scored both goals in a 2â0 win at Portman Road\nagainst City's East Anglian derby rivals Ipswich Town on 19 March 2000.[48]\nAlthough Roberts was personally enjoying the most productive spell of his career, his first four years at Carrow Road had seen the club struggle.\nThey had barely threatened to qualify for the end of season play-offs, ending the 2000â01 campaign in 15th place, six points above the relegation\nzone.[49] The 2001â02 season, with new manager Nigel Worthington in his first full season in charge,[50] saw the team fare better and they\nreached the Division One play-off final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.\n[51] Roberts missed much of the second half of the season because of\ninjury, but came off the substitute's bench in the final to give Norwich the lead in the first minute of extra-time with a header. Norwich lost the\nmatch in a penalty shoot-out after Birmingham City had equalised. Roberts took â and scored â the first penalty of the shoot-out but misses by\nPhil Mulryne and Daryl Sutch meant Birmingham won 4â2 and were promoted to the Premiership.[52]\nDuring the 2002â03 season, Roberts captained the Norwich team. That season, in a match against Sheffield Wednesday at Carrow Road, Roberts\nscored twice to move into third place on the list of Norwich City's all-time leading goalscorers, overtaking Robert Fleck in the process.[53] The\nCanaries faded after a good start to the season, finishing in eighth place and failing to qualify for the play-offs.[54] Roberts scored just 7 goals in 47\ngames.[55] The 2003â04 season would be his last at Carrow Road and although he was no longer an regular starter for the first team he played an\nUnder Nigel Worthington,\nRoberts became club\ncaptain, but also finished his\nNorwich City career.\nimportant part in one of the club's best-ever seasons. The team won the title and were promoted to the\nPremiership.[56] Roberts scored some important goals, including the winning strike in a top-of-the-table match\nagainst Sheffield United.\n[57] Roberts revealed in his autobiography that in February of that season he had a cancer\nscare and had to have a malignant melanoma removed from his arm.[58]\nA few days before the club's last home match of the 2003â04 season, Worthington announced that Roberts would not\nbe offered a new contract when his deal expired that summer. Worthington felt that, following promotion to the\nPremiership, the club had to look to the future and that Roberts was now surplus to requirements.[59] Although he\nhad made 41 league appearances that season, he started just 13 games.[60] With the championship already won,\nWorthington restored Roberts to the starting line-up for the last game of the season at Gresty Road against Crewe\nAlexandra and made him captain for the day. Roberts scored twice as City won 3â1;[61] he described the occasion and\nthe goal: \"I'd never scored on the final day of a season before, it was my final game in a Norwich shirt, which was a\nvery sad occasion, Nigel Worthington made me captain for the day and I'll be forever thankful for that, and I managed\nto cap it all off by getting two goals. One of them was a left footed volley into the top corner and I haven't got too\nmany of those in my career!\"[2]\n Overall, Roberts scored 96 goals in 306 games for Norwich.[61]\nAfter being released by Norwich, he received a number of offers to play for other clubs, including from Swiss side FC\nBasel, but eventually signed a two-year contract with Gillingham of the Championship, where he would be\nplayer/coach.[59] His debut was against Ipswich, Norwich's local rivals, and was booked after less than five seconds.[5] The move to Gillingham did\nnot prove a good one for him and he had a number of disagreements with the club, particularly with Stan Ternent after he succeeded Andy\nHessenthaler as manager.[5][62]\nIn December 2004 Roberts had himself served as joint caretaker manager, along with Darren Hare and Paul\nSmith, after the sudden departure of both Hessenthaler and initial caretaker John Gorman.\n[5]\nIn March 2005 he joined Cambridge United on loan\nuntil the end of the season to play under the management of former Norwich team-mate, Rob Newman.\n[2] He scored his 200th league goal on his\ndebut,[5] but Cambridge were relegated from League Two.[63] In August 2005, Roberts retired from playing after reaching an agreement with\nGillingham to pay the final year of his contract.[62]\nWhile a Watford player, Roberts was called up for Wales for the first time, an April 1989 friendly game against Israel.\n[64] He made his debut for the\nWelsh national team on 11 October 1989, when he took to the field in a 2â1 defeat to the Netherlands in a World Cup qualifier at the Racecourse\nGround, Wrexham. With both Ian Rush and Mark Hughes suspended, Roberts started the game alongside Malcolm Allen.[65] He had to wait more\nthan two years for his next international appearance, when his domestic form for Huddersfield saw him leading scorer in Division Two.[23] Roberts\nplayed in a 1â1 friendly against Austria in April 1992.[66] He earned two more caps that year at the Kirin Cup in Japan, suffering a 1â0 loss against\nArgentina and receiving a red card in a 1â0 victory over the host nation for a foul on Masami Ihara.\n[66][67] Roberts made three appearances for the\nsenior Wales team in 1994, including two qualification matches for UEFA Euro 1996 against Albania and Moldova.\n[66] He was not selected for\nWales again until 2000 when he made three appearances in friendlies, all losses against Finland, Brazil and Portugal.\n[66]\nGillingham and Cambridge United\nInternational career\nBellamy playing for Wales\nin 2011\nRoberts made four more appearances for his country in the qualification stages for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in 2000 and 2001.\n[66] He won a total\nof 15 caps for his country over a 12-year period, including a single appearance and one goal for the Wales B team,[68] but failed to score for the\nsenior team.[66] Roberts is phlegmatic that he made only 17 appearances (\"most as substitute\") for Wales, as he \"had to compete against the likes\nof Mark Hughes, Ian Rush, Dean Saunders, so there were some world-class strikers before me and I was just happy to get in the squad.\"[2] He\nregards the fact that he did not score for Wales as the greatest regret of his career.[69]\nStanding at 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m),[1] Roberts was known for scoring a high proportion of his goals with headers.[70] He had\na strong partnership with Craig Bellamy, beginning when Bellamy broke into the Norwich first team in 1997, aged\n18.[71] They also featured together for Wales, although Roberts never managed to score in 15 appearances for the\nnational side. Roberts said \"I absolutely loved playing up-front with [Bellamy] ... we hit it off straight away, probably\nmore so than anyone else I ever played with. It was like telepathy between us.\"[69] He described the relationship as \"the\nclassic big man, little man\" and noted that in their first season together for Norwich, Roberts scored 24 goals and\nBellamy 17.[69]\nIn 2004, Roberts published an account of his last season at Norwich, entitled All I want for Christmas .... The title of\nthe book was a joke based on Roberts' missing front teeth, a reference to the song \"All I Want for Christmas Is My Two\nFront Teeth\".[5] The book proved controversial, because it included an admission of a deliberate stamp on Wolves\ndefender Kevin Muscat, an incident that had taken place in 2000:\n\"As I got up I 'lost my balance' and trod on his back. Fourteen stone through eight studs, you do the maths.\nHe was in agony, but the ref didn't see it so I got away with it. Of course, I pulled him up and said 'Sorry\nmate, sorry mate', but he knew.\"[72]\nRoberts stated in the book that the stamp was a payback for a serious injury that Muscat had inflicted on Craig Bellamy while Bellamy and Roberts\nwere playing together for Norwich, and that Muscat held no grudges over it.[73]\nBecause of the coverage in the book, the Football Association retrospectively investigated the incident and Roberts, then playing at Gillingham,\nwas banned for three matches and fined Â£2,500 for the offence.[74] Roberts commented that this \"left 'a bitter taste' â especially after England\ncaptain David Beckham escaped without a punishment for his deliberate foul in the World Cup qualifier against Wales.\"[75] The Football\nAssociation said there was \"insufficient evidence\" to charge Beckham with bringing the game into disrepute. This was \"despite his admission in\nStyle of play\nAll I Want for Christmas ...\nIwan Roberts appearances, goals and scoring rate\nThe Daily Telegraph and subsequent apology.\"[76] At the time, Roberts told The Daily Telegraph, \"I do not want players to get suspensions and\nfines, but there must be consistency, regardless of who the player is.\"[76] The book was praised by critics. The Daily Telegraph called it \"a rollicking\ngood read. If it doesn't make you at least smile, then it's time to seek counselling.\"[77]\nRoberts has the UEFA A Licence for football coaching and, speaking in 2007, had not ruled out getting into management. He told the Eastern\nDaily Press, \"I've done my qualifications. It's just getting a club to give me a chance and taking it.\"[21] When Norwich sacked Nigel Worthington,\nRoberts applied for the manager's job. \"I tried to go for it ... knowing I wasn't going to get it but I'd never really been for an interview and I thought\nif I did it would stand me in good stead. But I never got a response from the club and that really disappointed me. A week after Peter Grant got the\njob I got a letter through the post saying 'We won't be considering you this time'. And I thought 'I've known that for the past seven days'.\"[21]\nRoberts works in the media. He is bilingual, speaking fluent Welsh, and provides Welsh-language commentary for Sky Sports and BBC Radio\nCymru.\n[78] He also works for BBC Cymru Wales.\n[79] He writes regularly for the local press in Norfolk,[80] commenting on Norwich City and also\ncontributes to the weekly podcast Elis James Feast of Football with comedian Elis James and fellow Welsh former international player Danny\nGabbidon.\n[81]\nRoberts was married in 2016,[82] and has three children; a son and twin\ndaughters.[75]\nIn January 2020, it was reported that Roberts had volunteered for dementia\nresearch.[70]\nIt followed research, published by the University of Glasgow in 2019.[83]\nHe has \"taken a series of simple memory, attention and spatial-awareness tests and\nhe will repeat them every six months\", and will ask former Norwich City colleagues to\ndo the same.[70] As early as in his 2004 autobiography, Roberts had attributed signs\nof memory loss to heading a football: \"I haven't got the best memory ... and I think\nthat comes from heading a football so often, especially in the early days when balls\nwere that bit heavier ... it must have taken its toll.\"[84]\nPost-playing career\nMedia work\nPersonal life\nLegacy\nIn 2002, Roberts was made an inaugural member of the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame.\n[85]\nIn 2007, Roberts came third in a vote run by the\nNorwich Evening News to determine which Norwich legend would be inaugurated into the Professional Footballers' Association Centenary Hall of\nFame.[86]\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition\nClub Season\nLeague FA Cup League Cup Other Total\nDivision Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals\nWatford\n1985â86\n[87] First Division 4 0 0 0 0 0 â 4 0\n1986â87\n[88] First Division 3 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 4 1\n1987â88\n[14] First Division 25 2 1 0 4 1 1\n[a] 0 31 3\n1988â89\n[16] Second Division 22 6 5 0 1 0 4\n[b] 0 32 6\n1989â90\n[18] Second Division 9 0 1 0 2 2 0 0 12 2\nTotal 63 9 7 0 8 3 5 0 83 12\nHuddersfield Town\n1990â91\n[26] Third Division 44 13 2 1 2 0 2\n[c] 0 50 14\n1991â92\n[27] Third Division 46 24 3 3 5 3 7\n[d] 4 61 34\n1992â93\n[28] Second Division 37 9 5 0 4 2 5\n[c] 4 51 15\n1993â94\n[29] Second Division 15 4 2 0 3 1 1\n[c] 0 21 5\nTotal 142 50 12 4 14 6 15 8 183 68\nLeicester City\n1993â94\n[89] First Division 26 13 â â 1\n[e] 0 27 13\n1994â95\n[34] Premiership 37 9 3 2 2 0 â 42 11\n1995â96\n[90] First Division 37 19 2 0 3 1 0 0 42 20\nTotal 100 41 5 2 5 1 1 0 111 44\nWolverhampton Wanderers 1996â97\n[40] First Division 33 12 1 0 2 0 2\n[e] 0 38 12\nNorwich City 1997â98\n[91] First Division 31 5 0 0 2 2 â 33 7\n1998â99\n[92] First Division 45 19 1 1 5 3 â 51 23\n1999â2000\n[93] First Division 44 17 1 0 4 2 â 49 19\nCareer statistics\nClub\n2000â01\n[94] First Division 44 15 1 1 5 3 â 50 19\n2001â02\n[95] First Division 30 13 0 0 1 0 3\n[e] 1 34 14\n2002â03\n[55] First Division 43 7 3 0 1 0 â 47 7\n2003â04\n[60] First Division 41 8 1 0 0 0 â 42 8\nTotal 278 84 7 2 18 10 3 1 306 97\nGillingham 2004â05\n[96] Championship 20 3 1 0 1 0 â 22 3\nCambridge United (loan) 2004â05\n[96] League Two 11 3 â â â 11 3\nCareer total 647 202 33 8 48 20 26 9 754 239\na.

In the verse charm, Sinthgunt is referred to as the sister of the personified sun, [Sunna](/wiki/S%C3%B3l_%28Germanic_mythology%29 \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\") (whose name is [alliterative](/wiki/Alliterative_verse \"Alliterative verse\") to *Sinthgunt*),[[1]](#cite_note-ORCHARD112-1) and the two sisters are cited as both producing incantations to heal the horse of [Phol](/wiki/Phol \"Phol\"), another otherwise unattested figure but possibly the same as [Balder](/wiki/Baldr \"Baldr\"), who is named elsewhere in the charm. The two are then followed by [Friia](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") and [Uolla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\"), also alliterative and stated as sisters.\n\nAs Sinthgunt is otherwise unattested, her significance is otherwise unknown, but some scholarly theories exist about her role in Germanic mythology based on proposed etymologies and the potential significance of her placement within the poem.\n\n## Etymology\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Etymology\")]\n\nThe etymology of *Sinthgunt* is unclear. In the original manuscript, *Sinthgunt* is spelled *Sin**ht**gunt* (emphasis added). In the 19th century, [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\") stuck strictly to this reading, proposing a complex compound based on Germanic *\\*Sin-naχt-gund*, i.e., \"the night-walking one\".[[2]](#cite_note-2) As a result of the pairing with Sunna, the personified sun (corresponding to Old Norse [Sól](/wiki/S%C3%B3l_%28Germanic_mythology%29 \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\")), this etymology has been interpreted as a reference to the [moon](/wiki/Moon \"Moon\"). However, this reading has yielded problems; the moon in Germanic mythology is considered masculine, exemplified in the personification of the moon in [Norse mythology](/wiki/Norse_mythology \"Norse mythology\"), [Máni](/wiki/M%C3%A1ni \"Máni\"), a male figure. According to [Rudolf Simek](/wiki/Rudolf_Simek \"Rudolf Simek\"), the historical record lacks evidence for any cult of personified celestial bodies among the ancient Germanic peoples.[[3]](#cite_note-3)\n\nStefan Schaffner rejects this etymology, as does [Heiner Eichner](/w/index.php?title=Heiner_Eichner&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Heiner Eichner (page does not exist)\") [[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiner_Eichner \"de:Heiner Eichner\")], because the first element *Sinht-* cannot be based on the presupposed earlier Germanic *\\*sinχt-*. Such a Germanic form would have yielded Old High German *\\*sīht* by regular sound change.[[4]](#cite_note-4) The amended *Sinthgunt* presupposes a Proto-Germanic compound *\\*Senþa-gunþjō*, the first element meaning \"raid, (military) campaign\", the second one \"fight\". This interpretation corresponds well to other Old High German female names such as *Sindhilt* (from *\\*Senþa-χilðijō*, with its second element also meaning \"fight\", cf. [Old Norse](/wiki/Old_Norse \"Old Norse\") *hildr*, [Old English](/wiki/Old_English \"Old English\") *hild*).[[5]](#cite_note-5) Simek also mentions the interpretation \"heavenly body, star\".[[6]](#cite_note-SIMEK285-286-6)\n\n## Placement\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Placement\")]\n\nThe figures [Fulla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\") (*Uolla*) and [Frigg](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") (*Friia*) are attested together in later Old Norse sources (though not as sisters), and theories have been proposed that Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. This notion has resulted in a theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of Sinthgunt and Sunna/Sól, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.[[7]](#cite_note-BOSTOCK29-7) Similarly, [Wolfgang Beck](/w/index.php?title=Wolfgang_Beck&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Wolfgang Beck (page does not exist)\") [[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Beck_%28Germanist%29 \"de:Wolfgang Beck (Germanist)\")] analysed her as a subordinate goddess from Sunna's retinue, a kind of \"situation goddess\", based on her unique appearance in the sources.[[8]](#cite_note-8)\n\n[Friedrich Kauffmann](/wiki/Friedrich_Kauffmann \"Friedrich Kauffmann\") classified Sinhtgunt as a [valkyrie](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\") in the 19th century, because the elements *-gund* and *-hild* appear frequently in their names.[[9]](#cite_note-9) Stefan Schaffner and Heiner Eichner more recently agreed with him, based on Günter Müller's paper on the valkyries' healing powers.[[10]](#cite_note-10)\n\n[Karl Helm](/wiki/Karl_Helm \"Karl Helm\") rejected Kauffmann and grouped Sinhtgunt with the [Idisi](/wiki/Idisi \"Idisi\") of the [First Merseburg Charm](/wiki/First_Merseburg_Charm \"First Merseburg Charm\"), as a specially defined group of Germanic goddesses.[[11]](#cite_note-11)\n\n## Notes\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-ORCHARD112_1-0)** Orchard (1997:112).\n2. **[^](#cite_ref-2)** [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\"). *Studien über die Entstehung der nordischen Götter- und Heldensagen*.

years](/wiki/Light_year \"Light year\") (700 [pc](/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\")) from [Earth](/wiki/Earth \"Earth\") in the constellation [Fornax](/wiki/Fornax \"Fornax\").\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\")\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6 \"#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6\") The star is part of the [Helmi stream](/wiki/Helmi_stream \"Helmi stream\"), a former [dwarf galaxy](/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy \"Dwarf galaxy\") that merged with the [Milky Way](/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") between six and nine billion years ago.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") As a result, HIP 13044 circles the [Galactic Center](/wiki/Galactic_Center \"Galactic Center\") at a highly irregular orbit with respect to the [galactic plane](/wiki/Galactic_plane \"Galactic plane\"). HIP 13044 is slightly less massive than the Sun, but is approximately seven times its size. The star, which is estimated to be at least nine billion years old, has passed the [red-giant](/wiki/Red_giant \"Red giant\") phase. The relatively fast rotation of the star may be due to having engulfed one or more planets during the red-giant phase.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")\n\n## Observational history\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Observational history\")\\]\nA science team from the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](/wiki/Max_Planck_Institute_for_Astronomy \"Max Planck Institute for Astronomy\") first observed HIP 13044 using [Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph](/w/index.php?title=Fiber-fed_Extended_Range_Optical_Spectrograph&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (page does not exist)\") (FEROS) at the [European Southern Observatory](/wiki/European_Southern_Observatory \"European Southern Observatory\")'s [La Silla Observatory](/wiki/La_Silla_Observatory \"La Silla Observatory\") in Chile. The first follow-up led to the collection of 36 [radial velocity](/wiki/Radial_velocity \"Radial velocity\") measurements taken between September 2009 and July 2010.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")\n\nThe team also used [photometric](</wiki/Photometry_(astronomy)> \"Photometry (astronomy)\") data that had been passively collected by and publicly released into the archive of the [SuperWASP](/wiki/SuperWASP \"SuperWASP\") collaboration, which had been observing the region where the star was located. In this data, HIP 13044 was found to oscillate; the signal was blocked roughly every sixteen days. Analysis of the SuperWASP and FEROS data led to the supposed discovery of the planet *HIP 13044 b*,\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") although this claim was later refuted.\n\n## Characteristics\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Characteristics\")\\]\nHIP 13044 is an [F-type](/wiki/Stellar_classification#Class_F \"Stellar classification\") star located approximately 701 [parsecs](/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\") (2,286 [light years](/wiki/Light_year \"Light year\")) from Earth in the [Helmi stream](/wiki/Helmi_stream \"Helmi stream\")\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")—a group of low-metallicity stars moving with large velocities relative to the Sun. The star follows an eccentric galactic orbit, with a distance from the galactic center ranging from 7 to 16 [kiloparsecs](/wiki/Kiloparsec \"Kiloparsec\").\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\") The orbit does not lie in the [galactic plane](/wiki/Galactic_plane \"Galactic plane\"), and can reach distances as high as 13 kpc above it. This indicates that it once was part of a satellite galaxy of the [Milky Way](/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") that was disrupted 6–9 billion years ago.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") The star itself is estimated to be at least nine billion years old.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\")\n\nHIP 13044 is fairly evolved star [fusing helium](/wiki/Triple-alpha_process \"Triple-alpha process\") in its core, and has therefore already passed the [red-giant](/wiki/Red_giant \"Red giant\") phase of its evolution.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") It lies near the blue end of the red horizontal branch bordering the [instability strip](/wiki/Instability_strip \"Instability strip\").\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") Its surface temperature is about 6025 K and its radius is approximately 6.7 [solar radii](/wiki/Solar_radius \"Solar radius\"). HIP 13044's mass is estimated to be 0.8 [solar masses](/wiki/Solar_mass \"Solar mass\").\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\") Having a rotation period of 5–6 days, HIP 13044 is a fast-rotating star for its type. It is possible that this is because it has swallowed planets during its red-giant phase.\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6 \"#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6\")\n\nHIP 13044 has an [apparent magnitude](/wiki/Apparent_magnitude \"Apparent magnitude\") of 9.94 and cannot be seen with the unaided eye.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\")\n\n## Claims of a planetary system\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Claims of a planetary system\")\\]\nIn 2010, it was announced that a giant planet in a 16.2-day orbit had been discovered by the radial velocity measurements. This would have had implications for planet formation in metal-poor systems and survival of planets being engulfed by expanded giant stars.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") Subsequent analysis of the data revealed problems with the detection: for example an erroneous barycentric correction had been applied (the same error had also led to claims of planets around [HIP 11952](/wiki/HIP_11952 \"HIP 11952\") that were subsequently refuted). After applying the corrections, there is no evidence for a planet orbiting the star.\\[[9]\\](#cite_note-JonesJenkins2014-9 \"#cite_note-JonesJenkins2014-9\")\n\n## References\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: References\")\\]\n\n1. ^ [***a***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-0 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-0\") [***b***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-1 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-1\") [***c***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-2 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-2\") [***d***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-3 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-3\") [***e***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-4 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-4\") [***f***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-5 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-5\") [Brown, A.

In the verse charm, Sinthgunt is referred to as the sister of the personified sun, [Sunna](</wiki/S%C3%B3l_(Germanic_mythology)> \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\") (whose name is [alliterative](/wiki/Alliterative_verse \"Alliterative verse\") to *Sinthgunt*),\\[[1]\\](#cite_note-ORCHARD112-1 \"#cite_note-ORCHARD112-1\") and the two sisters are cited as both producing incantations to heal the horse of [Phol](/wiki/Phol \"Phol\"), another otherwise unattested figure but possibly the same as [Balder](/wiki/Baldr \"Baldr\"), who is named elsewhere in the charm. The two are then followed by [Friia](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") and [Uolla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\"), also alliterative and stated as sisters.\n\nAs Sinthgunt is otherwise unattested, her significance is otherwise unknown, but some scholarly theories exist about her role in Germanic mythology based on proposed etymologies and the potential significance of her placement within the poem.\n\n## Etymology\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Etymology\")\\]\nThe etymology of *Sinthgunt* is unclear. In the original manuscript, *Sinthgunt* is spelled *Sin**ht**gunt* (emphasis added). In the 19th century, [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\") stuck strictly to this reading, proposing a complex compound based on Germanic *\\*Sin-naχt-gund*, i.e., \"the night-walking one\".\\[[2]\\](#cite_note-2 \"#cite_note-2\") As a result of the pairing with Sunna, the personified sun (corresponding to Old Norse [Sól](</wiki/S%C3%B3l_(Germanic_mythology)> \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\")), this etymology has been interpreted as a reference to the [moon](/wiki/Moon \"Moon\"). However, this reading has yielded problems; the moon in Germanic mythology is considered masculine, exemplified in the personification of the moon in [Norse mythology](/wiki/Norse_mythology \"Norse mythology\"), [Máni](/wiki/M%C3%A1ni \"Máni\"), a male figure. According to [Rudolf Simek](/wiki/Rudolf_Simek \"Rudolf Simek\"), the historical record lacks evidence for any cult of personified celestial bodies among the ancient Germanic peoples.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-3 \"#cite_note-3\")\n\nStefan Schaffner rejects this etymology, as does [Heiner Eichner](/w/index.php?title=Heiner_Eichner&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Heiner Eichner (page does not exist)\") \\[[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiner_Eichner \"de:Heiner Eichner\")\\], because the first element *Sinht-* cannot be based on the presupposed earlier Germanic *\\*sinχt-*. Such a Germanic form would have yielded Old High German *\\*sīht* by regular sound change.\\[[4]\\](#cite_note-4 \"#cite_note-4\") The amended *Sinthgunt* presupposes a Proto-Germanic compound *\\*Senþa-gunþjō*, the first element meaning \"raid, (military) campaign\", the second one \"fight\". This interpretation corresponds well to other Old High German female names such as *Sindhilt* (from *\\*Senþa-χilðijō*, with its second element also meaning \"fight\", cf. [Old Norse](/wiki/Old_Norse \"Old Norse\") *hildr*, [Old English](/wiki/Old_English \"Old English\") *hild*).\\[[5]\\](#cite_note-5 \"#cite_note-5\") Simek also mentions the interpretation \"heavenly body, star\".\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-SIMEK285-286-6 \"#cite_note-SIMEK285-286-6\")\n\n## Placement\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Placement\")\\]\nThe figures [Fulla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\") (*Uolla*) and [Frigg](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") (*Friia*) are attested together in later Old Norse sources (though not as sisters), and theories have been proposed that Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. This notion has resulted in a theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of Sinthgunt and Sunna/Sól, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-BOSTOCK29-7 \"#cite_note-BOSTOCK29-7\") Similarly, [Wolfgang Beck](/w/index.php?title=Wolfgang_Beck&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Wolfgang Beck (page does not exist)\") \\[[de](<https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Beck_(Germanist)> \"de:Wolfgang Beck (Germanist)\")\\] analysed her as a subordinate goddess from Sunna's retinue, a kind of \"situation goddess\", based on her unique appearance in the sources.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-8 \"#cite_note-8\")\n\n[Friedrich Kauffmann](/wiki/Friedrich_Kauffmann \"Friedrich Kauffmann\") classified Sinhtgunt as a [valkyrie](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\") in the 19th century, because the elements *-gund* and *-hild* appear frequently in their names.\\[[9]\\](#cite_note-9 \"#cite_note-9\") Stefan Schaffner and Heiner Eichner more recently agreed with him, based on Günter Müller's paper on the valkyries' healing powers.\\[[10]\\](#cite_note-10 \"#cite_note-10\")\n\n[Karl Helm](/wiki/Karl_Helm \"Karl Helm\") rejected Kauffmann and grouped Sinhtgunt with the [Idisi](/wiki/Idisi \"Idisi\") of the [First Merseburg Charm](/wiki/First_Merseburg_Charm \"First Merseburg Charm\"), as a specially defined group of Germanic goddesses.\\[[11]\\](#cite_note-11 \"#cite_note-11\")\n\n## Notes\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Notes\")\\]\n\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-ORCHARD112_1-0 \"#cite_ref-ORCHARD112_1-0\")** Orchard (1997:112).\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-2 \"#cite_ref-2\")** [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\"). *Studien über die Entstehung der nordischen Götter- und Heldensagen*.

But how do you do? I see I have frightened\nyou--sit down and tell me all the news.\"\n\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna Pavlovna\nScherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fedorovna. With\nthese words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man of high rank and\nimportance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna Pavlovna\nhad had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la\ngrippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the\nelite.\n\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered\nby a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n\n\"If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the\nprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,\nI shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10--Annette\nScherer.\"\n\n\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the least\ndisconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an\nembroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on\nhis breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that\nrefined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and\nwith the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance\nwho had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna,\nkissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,\nand complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n\n\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's mind\nat rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and\naffected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be\ndiscerned.\n\n\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like\nthese if one has any feeling?\" said Anna Pavlovna. \"You are staying the\nwhole evening, I hope?\"\n\n\"And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I must\nput in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is coming for\nme to take me there.\"\n\n\"I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these\nfestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\n\n\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been\nput off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit\nsaid things he did not even wish to be believed.\n\n\"Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's\ndispatch? You know everything.\"\n\n\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold, listless\ntone. \"What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has\nburnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.\"\n","extracted_metadata":{},"metadata_field_count":null,"attempts":1,"timestamp":1754064533.9749722,"platform":"Linux","python_version":"3.13.5"},{"file_path":"test_documents/text/selected_pdfs.txt","file_size":2374,"file_type":"txt","category":"tiny","framework":"markitdown","iteration":2,"extraction_time":0.007136106491088867,"startup_time":null,"peak_memory_mb":227.9609375,"avg_memory_mb":227.9609375,"peak_cpu_percent":402.1,"avg_cpu_percent":196.6,"total_io_mb":null,"status":"success","character_count":2374,"word_count":337,"error_type":null,"error_message":null,"quality_metrics":{"char_count":2374,"word_count":337,"sentence_count":46,"paragraph_count":6,"avg_word_length":6.029673590504451,"avg_sentence_length":7.913043478260869,"extraction_completeness":1.0,"text_coherence":0.8260869565217391,"noise_ratio":0.0,"gibberish_ratio":0.13924050632911392,"flesch_reading_ease":31.25250179629964,"gunning_fog_index":13.869193461469374,"has_proper_formatting":true,"maintains_line_breaks":true,"preserves_whitespace":false,"table_structure_preserved":false,"format_specific_score":0.0,"expected_content_preserved":false},"overall_quality_score":0.43308736637580936,"extracted_text":"# Selected PDFs for Benchmarking\n\n## Small PDFs (< 100KB)\n1.

He moved to Huddersfield Town in 1990 where he remained\nfor three seasons before transferring to Leicester City. Roberts signed for Wolverhampton\nWanderers after three further seasons, but stayed for a single campaign before transferring\nto Norwich City, where he spent seven years. He played international football for Wales and\namassed fifteen caps between 1989 and 2001, without scoring.\nRoberts made 647 league appearances during his career, almost half of which were for\nNorwich, where he overcame a weak start to become a fan favourite. At his peak, he scored\n61 goals in three seasons, and finished with two goals in his final game as Norwich achieved\npromotion to the Premiership. He was elected to the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame in\n2002, while still at the club. His professional career ended with spells at Gillingham and on\nloan to Cambridge United.\nSince retiring as a player, Roberts, who speaks fluent Welsh, has worked as a commentator\nfor Sky Sports, BBC Radio Cymru and BBC Cymru Wales. His book, All I Want for\nChristmas ..., a reference to his gap-toothed appearance, prompted both controversy and\npraise when it was published in 2004.\nIwan Wyn Roberts was born in Bangor, Gwynedd, on 26 June 1968,[1] and grew up in\nBarmouth, on the west coast of Wales as a Liverpool fan.[2]\nRoberts says that most football fans would know him (\"if you know me at all\") as \"that gaptoothed ginger lunk\".[3] He started losing his front tooth when he was just 10: his best\nfriend's heel chipping half of his tooth off, the result of an incident playing football.[4] Some\nyears later, a dentist removed the stump when an abscess developed.[4] He lost his second\nfront tooth as the result of an elbow to the mouth from Darran Rowbotham when he was\n18,[5]\n playing for Watford in a pre-season friendly.[4]\nEarly life\n2005 â Cambridge United (loan) 11 (3)\nTotal 647 (202)\nInternational career\n1989â2001 Wales 15 (0)\n1994 Wales B 1 (1)\nManagerial career\n2004 Gillingham (joint-caretaker)\n*Club domestic league appearances and goals\nRoberts credits his school PE teacher, Iolo Owen, as a great influence in his career,\nintroducing him into men's football aged 15: \"He picked me for the school team and got me\ninto the local men's team, Harlech Town ... as he was the manager ... it toughened me up\nand made me a lot stronger.\"[6] Critical to Roberts' thinking when he joined Watford was\nthat coach Tom Walley was, like himself, Welsh-speaking, as was professional Malcolm\nAllen, against whom Roberts had played in the local Welsh leagues.[7] He was also\ninfluenced by Graham Taylor's record of giving youth players opportunities.[8] Roberts\njoined Watford as a trainee, signing his first professional contract in July 1986, shortly after\nhis 18th birthday.[9]\nRoberts made his first-team debut during the 1985â86 season and scored his first goal in professional football on 16 September 1986; it was the\nonly goal in a 1â0 win against Manchester United at Vicarage Road.\n[10] Having made only one full first team appearance for Watford prior to the\nmatch, Roberts came on as a second-half substitute to score the winning goal from a narrow angle.[11] Watford ended the season in ninth\nposition,[12] and despite having three years of his contract remaining, Taylor left the club to join Aston Villa.\n[13] Roberts broke through in the\nfollowing season, making 31 appearances in all competitions and scoring three goals, but Watford finished 19th in the table and were relegated to\nthe Second Division.\n[14][15] The 1988â89 season saw him make 32 appearances in total, scoring six goals,[16] with Watford finishing fourth, but\nfailing to progress past the 1989 Football League play-offs.\n[17] Roberts' chances were restricted the following season, when he made just nine\nleague appearances, scoring twice.[18]\nHe scored nine goals in 63 league matches in total for Watford,[19] but felt that he was failing to get enough opportunities and moved to Division\nThree club Huddersfield Town prior to the start of the 1990â91 season, for Â£275,000.[8][19][20] One of his contemporaries at Watford was future\nNorwich City manager, Glenn Roeder. Roberts remembers Roeder as \"an absolute gentleman ... I can't speak highly enough of him. He helped me\na great deal with his experience and any problems that the young lads had they knew he would help them with.\"[21]\nRoberts credits a lot of his success as a striker to the interaction he had with Huddersfield's then first-team coach, Peter Withe: \"Peter was\nexceptional in the air and he taught me so much on how to use my physicality properly and how to move defenders about especially in the penalty\nbox which would enable me a bit more time and space in the box.\"[22] The club then signed Frank Stapleton, who helped the young Roberts\ndevelop \"awareness in the opposition's penalty box\" and how to \"steal goals\" to increase his goal tally, getting a final touch to 'help' a goalbound\nball cross the line.[22]\nThe 1991â92 season brought Roberts a club post-war record 34 goals in a season, 24 of which were in the league, making him joint top-scorer in\nthe division.[2][8][23] His efforts helped the club to finish third and qualify for the play-offs.\n[24] There they lost to Peterborough United where\nRoberts failed to score in either leg.[8][25] Overall, whilst playing for Huddersfield he scored 50 goals in 142 games.[26][27][28][29]\nIn November\nClub career\nWatford\nHuddersfield Town\n1993 he was signed by the Second Division club Leicester City for Â£300,000.[19][30] Neil Warnock, Huddersfield's manager, needed to sell players\nand Leicester manager Brian Little took an interest.[31]\nRoberts made his debut for Leicester in a Midlands derby against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n[31] At half time, Leicester were two goals behind\nand he expected manager Brian Little, \"the nicest man\" he ever played for to rant in the dressing room, but instead he quietly told the players he\nwas going to make two substitutions.[32]\nIn the second half, Roberts scored two goals to secure a draw.[32] After retiring, Roberts said he still\nregretted not completing a hat-trick in the match, a feat he did achieve in April 1994, in a 28-minute spell against local rivals Derby County.\n[31] As\nrecently as 2017, this achievement is still recalled in a chant by Leicester City fans.[33] Roberts broke some ribs a few weeks later and returned to\nthe first-team squad just in time for the 1993â94 play-off final, which Leicester won 2â1 against Derby.[31]\nIn the 1994â95 Premiership, Leicester struggled and were relegated, but Roberts was the club's top scorer with 11 goals in all competitions.[31][34]\nHe scored another 19 goals the following season, as Leicester reached the play-offs again.[35]\nIn the semi-final, Leicester drew 0-0 with Stoke City\nin the first leg at home and won 1-0 in the second leg from a Garry Parker goal, to qualify for the final.\n[36] What followed was one of the only two\nincidents that \"bugged\" Roberts during his playing career: while celebrating the win, he suddenly realised he was in danger due to a pitch invasion\nby Stoke supporters.[36] He managed to escape, but some of his team-mates, including Neil Lennon and Muzzy Izzet were less fortunate, and had\nto be protected by police.[36][37] Although it was reported that Roberts had recovered from injury,[38] he was not selected for the squad for the\nplay-off final against Crystal Palace. Leicester won the match which secured them promotion to the Premiership.[35] With the side promoted again,\nLeicester decided to sell Roberts to Wolves.[31] In all, Roberts scored 41 goals in 100 league games for Leicester.[19]\nHis goals and performances for Leicester persuaded Wolves to sign Roberts for Â£1.3m in the summer of 1996.[39] He spent only one season at\nMolineux in which he scored 12 goals in 33 games, including one hat-trick for the club in a match against their local rivals West Bromwich Albion\nin the Black Country derby.\n[39][40] Wolves ended the season in third place but lost 4â3 on aggregate to Crystal Palace in the play-offs, with Roberts\nfailing to score in either leg.[41]\nIn the summer off-season of 1997, Roberts returned from holiday and came into the club for the first day of pre-season training where manager\nMark McGhee called him into his office. There McGhee said that he had been told that in order to bring in new players, he had to sell first, and that\nRoberts was the only player for whom an offer had been made â by Norwich City.[42] Roberts did not want to leave the club, but accepted that if\nthe manager did not want him there, he needed to go.[42]\nIn July 1997, Norwich City manager Mike Walker paid Â£850,000 to Wolves to secure the services of Roberts.[43] His time at the club (nicknamed\nthe Canaries) did not begin happily, however. Following his debut in August 1997 against his former club Wolves, he struggled throughout the\n1997â98 season and scored just seven goals; \"there were certainly those in the stands who were questioning whether he was worth the near\nÂ£1,000,000 splashed out on him\".[44] There were crowd chants about him being a \"waste of money\" and Roberts remembers that someone wrote\nLeicester City\nWolverhampton Wanderers\nNorwich City\nto the Eastern Daily Press and described him as \"the worst ever to wear a Norwich shirt\", adding the reflection that \"it was the bleakest period of\nall my years as a pro.\"[42] Roberts had scored just four goals heading into the end of the season; however, his fitness slowly began to improve and\n\"three goals in the final two home games of the season left in good heart for the next campaign\".[44] Walker was sacked at the end of the season,\nand Roberts blames himself for this happening â a result of his lack of goals.[42]\nWalker was replaced during the summer by Bruce Rioch. During pre-season training, Roberts weighed in at 15 stone 3 pounds (97 kg), with a body\nfat ratio of 16â17%, when his \"fighting weight\" should have been \"just under 14 stone with around 13 per cent body fat.\"[45] The turnaround was,\naccording to Roberts, due to some clever psychology by Rioch:\n\"Bruce was very clever: he didn't issue me with an ultimatum, he didn't rant and rave or threaten me. He just said, \"Tom Walley would\nbe proud of you\". Tom was my youth team manager at Watford and absolutely hated people being out of shape ... It was a gentle hint,\nbut I realised ... I had to sort it out myself.\"[45]\nRoberts threw himself into weight training and soon reached a target weight of 13 stone 10 pounds.[45]\nIt paid off: that season, Roberts scored 23\ngoals.[44] He was partnered by what the Eastern Daily Press described as the \"flourishing talent\" of Craig Bellamy who scored 19 goals. Norwich\nfinished in the top half of the table and the Canaries fans voted Roberts player of the season.\n[44]\nIn the 1999â2000 season he was again top scorer\n(19 goals in 49 games) and retained the player of the season award. He just missed out on becoming the first player in the club's history to win the\naward three years in a row when Andy Marshall finished narrowly ahead of him in the voting for the 2000â01 season.\n[46]\nDuring that 1999â2000 campaign there was speculation about Roberts's future as his contract was due to expire in the summer of 2000.[47]\nRoberts had an agent, former team-mate and close friend David Speedie, who advised him to turn down Norwich's offer and sign for Nottingham\nForest or Huddersfield Town. Ultimately, \"he couldn't produce anything on paper that told me I'd be signing ... so I could have got injured in\ntraining, never played again and not got a penny.\"[47] As a result, the two men fell out and Roberts did not use the services of an agent again,\nrepresenting himself in contract negotiations.[47] Shortly after he signed a contract extension in January of that season, Bruce Rioch left the club\nand was succeeded by Bryan Hamilton. Roberts helped Hamilton make a good start when he scored both goals in a 2â0 win at Portman Road\nagainst City's East Anglian derby rivals Ipswich Town on 19 March 2000.[48]\nAlthough Roberts was personally enjoying the most productive spell of his career, his first four years at Carrow Road had seen the club struggle.\nThey had barely threatened to qualify for the end of season play-offs, ending the 2000â01 campaign in 15th place, six points above the relegation\nzone.[49] The 2001â02 season, with new manager Nigel Worthington in his first full season in charge,[50] saw the team fare better and they\nreached the Division One play-off final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.\n[51] Roberts missed much of the second half of the season because of\ninjury, but came off the substitute's bench in the final to give Norwich the lead in the first minute of extra-time with a header. Norwich lost the\nmatch in a penalty shoot-out after Birmingham City had equalised. Roberts took â and scored â the first penalty of the shoot-out but misses by\nPhil Mulryne and Daryl Sutch meant Birmingham won 4â2 and were promoted to the Premiership.[52]\nDuring the 2002â03 season, Roberts captained the Norwich team. That season, in a match against Sheffield Wednesday at Carrow Road, Roberts\nscored twice to move into third place on the list of Norwich City's all-time leading goalscorers, overtaking Robert Fleck in the process.[53] The\nCanaries faded after a good start to the season, finishing in eighth place and failing to qualify for the play-offs.[54] Roberts scored just 7 goals in 47\ngames.[55] The 2003â04 season would be his last at Carrow Road and although he was no longer an regular starter for the first team he played an\nUnder Nigel Worthington,\nRoberts became club\ncaptain, but also finished his\nNorwich City career.\nimportant part in one of the club's best-ever seasons. The team won the title and were promoted to the\nPremiership.[56] Roberts scored some important goals, including the winning strike in a top-of-the-table match\nagainst Sheffield United.\n[57] Roberts revealed in his autobiography that in February of that season he had a cancer\nscare and had to have a malignant melanoma removed from his arm.[58]\nA few days before the club's last home match of the 2003â04 season, Worthington announced that Roberts would not\nbe offered a new contract when his deal expired that summer. Worthington felt that, following promotion to the\nPremiership, the club had to look to the future and that Roberts was now surplus to requirements.[59] Although he\nhad made 41 league appearances that season, he started just 13 games.[60] With the championship already won,\nWorthington restored Roberts to the starting line-up for the last game of the season at Gresty Road against Crewe\nAlexandra and made him captain for the day. Roberts scored twice as City won 3â1;[61] he described the occasion and\nthe goal: \"I'd never scored on the final day of a season before, it was my final game in a Norwich shirt, which was a\nvery sad occasion, Nigel Worthington made me captain for the day and I'll be forever thankful for that, and I managed\nto cap it all off by getting two goals. One of them was a left footed volley into the top corner and I haven't got too\nmany of those in my career!\"[2]\n Overall, Roberts scored 96 goals in 306 games for Norwich.[61]\nAfter being released by Norwich, he received a number of offers to play for other clubs, including from Swiss side FC\nBasel, but eventually signed a two-year contract with Gillingham of the Championship, where he would be\nplayer/coach.[59] His debut was against Ipswich, Norwich's local rivals, and was booked after less than five seconds.[5] The move to Gillingham did\nnot prove a good one for him and he had a number of disagreements with the club, particularly with Stan Ternent after he succeeded Andy\nHessenthaler as manager.[5][62]\nIn December 2004 Roberts had himself served as joint caretaker manager, along with Darren Hare and Paul\nSmith, after the sudden departure of both Hessenthaler and initial caretaker John Gorman.\n[5]\nIn March 2005 he joined Cambridge United on loan\nuntil the end of the season to play under the management of former Norwich team-mate, Rob Newman.\n[2] He scored his 200th league goal on his\ndebut,[5] but Cambridge were relegated from League Two.[63] In August 2005, Roberts retired from playing after reaching an agreement with\nGillingham to pay the final year of his contract.[62]\nWhile a Watford player, Roberts was called up for Wales for the first time, an April 1989 friendly game against Israel.\n[64] He made his debut for the\nWelsh national team on 11 October 1989, when he took to the field in a 2â1 defeat to the Netherlands in a World Cup qualifier at the Racecourse\nGround, Wrexham. With both Ian Rush and Mark Hughes suspended, Roberts started the game alongside Malcolm Allen.[65] He had to wait more\nthan two years for his next international appearance, when his domestic form for Huddersfield saw him leading scorer in Division Two.[23] Roberts\nplayed in a 1â1 friendly against Austria in April 1992.[66] He earned two more caps that year at the Kirin Cup in Japan, suffering a 1â0 loss against\nArgentina and receiving a red card in a 1â0 victory over the host nation for a foul on Masami Ihara.\n[66][67] Roberts made three appearances for the\nsenior Wales team in 1994, including two qualification matches for UEFA Euro 1996 against Albania and Moldova.\n[66] He was not selected for\nWales again until 2000 when he made three appearances in friendlies, all losses against Finland, Brazil and Portugal.\n[66]\nGillingham and Cambridge United\nInternational career\nBellamy playing for Wales\nin 2011\nRoberts made four more appearances for his country in the qualification stages for the 2002 FIFA World Cup in 2000 and 2001.\n[66] He won a total\nof 15 caps for his country over a 12-year period, including a single appearance and one goal for the Wales B team,[68] but failed to score for the\nsenior team.[66] Roberts is phlegmatic that he made only 17 appearances (\"most as substitute\") for Wales, as he \"had to compete against the likes\nof Mark Hughes, Ian Rush, Dean Saunders, so there were some world-class strikers before me and I was just happy to get in the squad.\"[2] He\nregards the fact that he did not score for Wales as the greatest regret of his career.[69]\nStanding at 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m),[1] Roberts was known for scoring a high proportion of his goals with headers.[70] He had\na strong partnership with Craig Bellamy, beginning when Bellamy broke into the Norwich first team in 1997, aged\n18.[71] They also featured together for Wales, although Roberts never managed to score in 15 appearances for the\nnational side. Roberts said \"I absolutely loved playing up-front with [Bellamy] ... we hit it off straight away, probably\nmore so than anyone else I ever played with. It was like telepathy between us.\"[69] He described the relationship as \"the\nclassic big man, little man\" and noted that in their first season together for Norwich, Roberts scored 24 goals and\nBellamy 17.[69]\nIn 2004, Roberts published an account of his last season at Norwich, entitled All I want for Christmas .... The title of\nthe book was a joke based on Roberts' missing front teeth, a reference to the song \"All I Want for Christmas Is My Two\nFront Teeth\".[5] The book proved controversial, because it included an admission of a deliberate stamp on Wolves\ndefender Kevin Muscat, an incident that had taken place in 2000:\n\"As I got up I 'lost my balance' and trod on his back. Fourteen stone through eight studs, you do the maths.\nHe was in agony, but the ref didn't see it so I got away with it. Of course, I pulled him up and said 'Sorry\nmate, sorry mate', but he knew.\"[72]\nRoberts stated in the book that the stamp was a payback for a serious injury that Muscat had inflicted on Craig Bellamy while Bellamy and Roberts\nwere playing together for Norwich, and that Muscat held no grudges over it.[73]\nBecause of the coverage in the book, the Football Association retrospectively investigated the incident and Roberts, then playing at Gillingham,\nwas banned for three matches and fined Â£2,500 for the offence.[74] Roberts commented that this \"left 'a bitter taste' â especially after England\ncaptain David Beckham escaped without a punishment for his deliberate foul in the World Cup qualifier against Wales.\"[75] The Football\nAssociation said there was \"insufficient evidence\" to charge Beckham with bringing the game into disrepute. This was \"despite his admission in\nStyle of play\nAll I Want for Christmas ...\nIwan Roberts appearances, goals and scoring rate\nThe Daily Telegraph and subsequent apology.\"[76] At the time, Roberts told The Daily Telegraph, \"I do not want players to get suspensions and\nfines, but there must be consistency, regardless of who the player is.\"[76] The book was praised by critics. The Daily Telegraph called it \"a rollicking\ngood read. If it doesn't make you at least smile, then it's time to seek counselling.\"[77]\nRoberts has the UEFA A Licence for football coaching and, speaking in 2007, had not ruled out getting into management. He told the Eastern\nDaily Press, \"I've done my qualifications. It's just getting a club to give me a chance and taking it.\"[21] When Norwich sacked Nigel Worthington,\nRoberts applied for the manager's job. \"I tried to go for it ... knowing I wasn't going to get it but I'd never really been for an interview and I thought\nif I did it would stand me in good stead. But I never got a response from the club and that really disappointed me. A week after Peter Grant got the\njob I got a letter through the post saying 'We won't be considering you this time'. And I thought 'I've known that for the past seven days'.\"[21]\nRoberts works in the media. He is bilingual, speaking fluent Welsh, and provides Welsh-language commentary for Sky Sports and BBC Radio\nCymru.\n[78] He also works for BBC Cymru Wales.\n[79] He writes regularly for the local press in Norfolk,[80] commenting on Norwich City and also\ncontributes to the weekly podcast Elis James Feast of Football with comedian Elis James and fellow Welsh former international player Danny\nGabbidon.\n[81]\nRoberts was married in 2016,[82] and has three children; a son and twin\ndaughters.[75]\nIn January 2020, it was reported that Roberts had volunteered for dementia\nresearch.[70]\nIt followed research, published by the University of Glasgow in 2019.[83]\nHe has \"taken a series of simple memory, attention and spatial-awareness tests and\nhe will repeat them every six months\", and will ask former Norwich City colleagues to\ndo the same.[70] As early as in his 2004 autobiography, Roberts had attributed signs\nof memory loss to heading a football: \"I haven't got the best memory ... and I think\nthat comes from heading a football so often, especially in the early days when balls\nwere that bit heavier ... it must have taken its toll.\"[84]\nPost-playing career\nMedia work\nPersonal life\nLegacy\nIn 2002, Roberts was made an inaugural member of the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame.\n[85]\nIn 2007, Roberts came third in a vote run by the\nNorwich Evening News to determine which Norwich legend would be inaugurated into the Professional Footballers' Association Centenary Hall of\nFame.[86]\nAppearances and goals by club, season and competition\nClub Season\nLeague FA Cup League Cup Other Total\nDivision Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals Apps Goals\nWatford\n1985â86\n[87] First Division 4 0 0 0 0 0 â 4 0\n1986â87\n[88] First Division 3 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 4 1\n1987â88\n[14] First Division 25 2 1 0 4 1 1\n[a] 0 31 3\n1988â89\n[16] Second Division 22 6 5 0 1 0 4\n[b] 0 32 6\n1989â90\n[18] Second Division 9 0 1 0 2 2 0 0 12 2\nTotal 63 9 7 0 8 3 5 0 83 12\nHuddersfield Town\n1990â91\n[26] Third Division 44 13 2 1 2 0 2\n[c] 0 50 14\n1991â92\n[27] Third Division 46 24 3 3 5 3 7\n[d] 4 61 34\n1992â93\n[28] Second Division 37 9 5 0 4 2 5\n[c] 4 51 15\n1993â94\n[29] Second Division 15 4 2 0 3 1 1\n[c] 0 21 5\nTotal 142 50 12 4 14 6 15 8 183 68\nLeicester City\n1993â94\n[89] First Division 26 13 â â 1\n[e] 0 27 13\n1994â95\n[34] Premiership 37 9 3 2 2 0 â 42 11\n1995â96\n[90] First Division 37 19 2 0 3 1 0 0 42 20\nTotal 100 41 5 2 5 1 1 0 111 44\nWolverhampton Wanderers 1996â97\n[40] First Division 33 12 1 0 2 0 2\n[e] 0 38 12\nNorwich City 1997â98\n[91] First Division 31 5 0 0 2 2 â 33 7\n1998â99\n[92] First Division 45 19 1 1 5 3 â 51 23\n1999â2000\n[93] First Division 44 17 1 0 4 2 â 49 19\nCareer statistics\nClub\n2000â01\n[94] First Division 44 15 1 1 5 3 â 50 19\n2001â02\n[95] First Division 30 13 0 0 1 0 3\n[e] 1 34 14\n2002â03\n[55] First Division 43 7 3 0 1 0 â 47 7\n2003â04\n[60] First Division 41 8 1 0 0 0 â 42 8\nTotal 278 84 7 2 18 10 3 1 306 97\nGillingham 2004â05\n[96] Championship 20 3 1 0 1 0 â 22 3\nCambridge United (loan) 2004â05\n[96] League Two 11 3 â â â 11 3\nCareer total 647 202 33 8 48 20 26 9 754 239\na.

In the verse charm, Sinthgunt is referred to as the sister of the personified sun, [Sunna](/wiki/S%C3%B3l_%28Germanic_mythology%29 \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\") (whose name is [alliterative](/wiki/Alliterative_verse \"Alliterative verse\") to *Sinthgunt*),[[1]](#cite_note-ORCHARD112-1) and the two sisters are cited as both producing incantations to heal the horse of [Phol](/wiki/Phol \"Phol\"), another otherwise unattested figure but possibly the same as [Balder](/wiki/Baldr \"Baldr\"), who is named elsewhere in the charm. The two are then followed by [Friia](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") and [Uolla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\"), also alliterative and stated as sisters.\n\nAs Sinthgunt is otherwise unattested, her significance is otherwise unknown, but some scholarly theories exist about her role in Germanic mythology based on proposed etymologies and the potential significance of her placement within the poem.\n\n## Etymology\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Etymology\")]\n\nThe etymology of *Sinthgunt* is unclear. In the original manuscript, *Sinthgunt* is spelled *Sin**ht**gunt* (emphasis added). In the 19th century, [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\") stuck strictly to this reading, proposing a complex compound based on Germanic *\\*Sin-naχt-gund*, i.e., \"the night-walking one\".[[2]](#cite_note-2) As a result of the pairing with Sunna, the personified sun (corresponding to Old Norse [Sól](/wiki/S%C3%B3l_%28Germanic_mythology%29 \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\")), this etymology has been interpreted as a reference to the [moon](/wiki/Moon \"Moon\"). However, this reading has yielded problems; the moon in Germanic mythology is considered masculine, exemplified in the personification of the moon in [Norse mythology](/wiki/Norse_mythology \"Norse mythology\"), [Máni](/wiki/M%C3%A1ni \"Máni\"), a male figure. According to [Rudolf Simek](/wiki/Rudolf_Simek \"Rudolf Simek\"), the historical record lacks evidence for any cult of personified celestial bodies among the ancient Germanic peoples.[[3]](#cite_note-3)\n\nStefan Schaffner rejects this etymology, as does [Heiner Eichner](/w/index.php?title=Heiner_Eichner&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Heiner Eichner (page does not exist)\") [[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiner_Eichner \"de:Heiner Eichner\")], because the first element *Sinht-* cannot be based on the presupposed earlier Germanic *\\*sinχt-*. Such a Germanic form would have yielded Old High German *\\*sīht* by regular sound change.[[4]](#cite_note-4) The amended *Sinthgunt* presupposes a Proto-Germanic compound *\\*Senþa-gunþjō*, the first element meaning \"raid, (military) campaign\", the second one \"fight\". This interpretation corresponds well to other Old High German female names such as *Sindhilt* (from *\\*Senþa-χilðijō*, with its second element also meaning \"fight\", cf. [Old Norse](/wiki/Old_Norse \"Old Norse\") *hildr*, [Old English](/wiki/Old_English \"Old English\") *hild*).[[5]](#cite_note-5) Simek also mentions the interpretation \"heavenly body, star\".[[6]](#cite_note-SIMEK285-286-6)\n\n## Placement\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Placement\")]\n\nThe figures [Fulla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\") (*Uolla*) and [Frigg](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") (*Friia*) are attested together in later Old Norse sources (though not as sisters), and theories have been proposed that Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. This notion has resulted in a theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of Sinthgunt and Sunna/Sól, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.[[7]](#cite_note-BOSTOCK29-7) Similarly, [Wolfgang Beck](/w/index.php?title=Wolfgang_Beck&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Wolfgang Beck (page does not exist)\") [[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Beck_%28Germanist%29 \"de:Wolfgang Beck (Germanist)\")] analysed her as a subordinate goddess from Sunna's retinue, a kind of \"situation goddess\", based on her unique appearance in the sources.[[8]](#cite_note-8)\n\n[Friedrich Kauffmann](/wiki/Friedrich_Kauffmann \"Friedrich Kauffmann\") classified Sinhtgunt as a [valkyrie](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\") in the 19th century, because the elements *-gund* and *-hild* appear frequently in their names.[[9]](#cite_note-9) Stefan Schaffner and Heiner Eichner more recently agreed with him, based on Günter Müller's paper on the valkyries' healing powers.[[10]](#cite_note-10)\n\n[Karl Helm](/wiki/Karl_Helm \"Karl Helm\") rejected Kauffmann and grouped Sinhtgunt with the [Idisi](/wiki/Idisi \"Idisi\") of the [First Merseburg Charm](/wiki/First_Merseburg_Charm \"First Merseburg Charm\"), as a specially defined group of Germanic goddesses.[[11]](#cite_note-11)\n\n## Notes\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Notes\")]\n\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-ORCHARD112_1-0)** Orchard (1997:112).\n2. **[^](#cite_ref-2)** [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\"). *Studien über die Entstehung der nordischen Götter- und Heldensagen*.

years](/wiki/Light_year \"Light year\") (700 [pc](/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\")) from [Earth](/wiki/Earth \"Earth\") in the constellation [Fornax](/wiki/Fornax \"Fornax\").\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\")\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6 \"#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6\") The star is part of the [Helmi stream](/wiki/Helmi_stream \"Helmi stream\"), a former [dwarf galaxy](/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy \"Dwarf galaxy\") that merged with the [Milky Way](/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") between six and nine billion years ago.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") As a result, HIP 13044 circles the [Galactic Center](/wiki/Galactic_Center \"Galactic Center\") at a highly irregular orbit with respect to the [galactic plane](/wiki/Galactic_plane \"Galactic plane\"). HIP 13044 is slightly less massive than the Sun, but is approximately seven times its size. The star, which is estimated to be at least nine billion years old, has passed the [red-giant](/wiki/Red_giant \"Red giant\") phase. The relatively fast rotation of the star may be due to having engulfed one or more planets during the red-giant phase.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")\n\n## Observational history\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Observational history\")\\]\nA science team from the [Max Planck Institute for Astronomy](/wiki/Max_Planck_Institute_for_Astronomy \"Max Planck Institute for Astronomy\") first observed HIP 13044 using [Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph](/w/index.php?title=Fiber-fed_Extended_Range_Optical_Spectrograph&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph (page does not exist)\") (FEROS) at the [European Southern Observatory](/wiki/European_Southern_Observatory \"European Southern Observatory\")'s [La Silla Observatory](/wiki/La_Silla_Observatory \"La Silla Observatory\") in Chile. The first follow-up led to the collection of 36 [radial velocity](/wiki/Radial_velocity \"Radial velocity\") measurements taken between September 2009 and July 2010.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")\n\nThe team also used [photometric](</wiki/Photometry_(astronomy)> \"Photometry (astronomy)\") data that had been passively collected by and publicly released into the archive of the [SuperWASP](/wiki/SuperWASP \"SuperWASP\") collaboration, which had been observing the region where the star was located. In this data, HIP 13044 was found to oscillate; the signal was blocked roughly every sixteen days. Analysis of the SuperWASP and FEROS data led to the supposed discovery of the planet *HIP 13044 b*,\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") although this claim was later refuted.\n\n## Characteristics\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Characteristics\")\\]\nHIP 13044 is an [F-type](/wiki/Stellar_classification#Class_F \"Stellar classification\") star located approximately 701 [parsecs](/wiki/Parsec \"Parsec\") (2,286 [light years](/wiki/Light_year \"Light year\")) from Earth in the [Helmi stream](/wiki/Helmi_stream \"Helmi stream\")\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\")—a group of low-metallicity stars moving with large velocities relative to the Sun. The star follows an eccentric galactic orbit, with a distance from the galactic center ranging from 7 to 16 [kiloparsecs](/wiki/Kiloparsec \"Kiloparsec\").\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\") The orbit does not lie in the [galactic plane](/wiki/Galactic_plane \"Galactic plane\"), and can reach distances as high as 13 kpc above it. This indicates that it once was part of a satellite galaxy of the [Milky Way](/wiki/Milky_Way \"Milky Way\") that was disrupted 6–9 billion years ago.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") The star itself is estimated to be at least nine billion years old.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\")\n\nHIP 13044 is fairly evolved star [fusing helium](/wiki/Triple-alpha_process \"Triple-alpha process\") in its core, and has therefore already passed the [red-giant](/wiki/Red_giant \"Red giant\") phase of its evolution.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") It lies near the blue end of the red horizontal branch bordering the [instability strip](/wiki/Instability_strip \"Instability strip\").\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3 \"#cite_note-Setiawan2010-3\") Its surface temperature is about 6025 K and its radius is approximately 6.7 [solar radii](/wiki/Solar_radius \"Solar radius\"). HIP 13044's mass is estimated to be 0.8 [solar masses](/wiki/Solar_mass \"Solar mass\").\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\") Having a rotation period of 5–6 days, HIP 13044 is a fast-rotating star for its type. It is possible that this is because it has swallowed planets during its red-giant phase.\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6 \"#cite_note-Than2010-11-18-6\")\n\nHIP 13044 has an [apparent magnitude](/wiki/Apparent_magnitude \"Apparent magnitude\") of 9.94 and cannot be seen with the unaided eye.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8 \"#cite_note-HIP_13044_b_at_Exoplanet.eu-8\")\n\n## Claims of a planetary system\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Claims of a planetary system\")\\]\nIn 2010, it was announced that a giant planet in a 16.2-day orbit had been discovered by the radial velocity measurements. This would have had implications for planet formation in metal-poor systems and survival of planets being engulfed by expanded giant stars.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-Klement2010-7 \"#cite_note-Klement2010-7\") Subsequent analysis of the data revealed problems with the detection: for example an erroneous barycentric correction had been applied (the same error had also led to claims of planets around [HIP 11952](/wiki/HIP_11952 \"HIP 11952\") that were subsequently refuted). After applying the corrections, there is no evidence for a planet orbiting the star.\\[[9]\\](#cite_note-JonesJenkins2014-9 \"#cite_note-JonesJenkins2014-9\")\n\n## References\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=HIP_13044&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: References\")\\]\n\n1. ^ [***a***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-0 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-0\") [***b***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-1 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-1\") [***c***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-2 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-2\") [***d***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-3 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-3\") [***e***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-4 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-4\") [***f***](#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-5 \"#cite_ref-GaiaDR2_1-5\") [Brown, A.

In the verse charm, Sinthgunt is referred to as the sister of the personified sun, [Sunna](</wiki/S%C3%B3l_(Germanic_mythology)> \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\") (whose name is [alliterative](/wiki/Alliterative_verse \"Alliterative verse\") to *Sinthgunt*),\\[[1]\\](#cite_note-ORCHARD112-1 \"#cite_note-ORCHARD112-1\") and the two sisters are cited as both producing incantations to heal the horse of [Phol](/wiki/Phol \"Phol\"), another otherwise unattested figure but possibly the same as [Balder](/wiki/Baldr \"Baldr\"), who is named elsewhere in the charm. The two are then followed by [Friia](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") and [Uolla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\"), also alliterative and stated as sisters.\n\nAs Sinthgunt is otherwise unattested, her significance is otherwise unknown, but some scholarly theories exist about her role in Germanic mythology based on proposed etymologies and the potential significance of her placement within the poem.\n\n## Etymology\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Etymology\")\\]\nThe etymology of *Sinthgunt* is unclear. In the original manuscript, *Sinthgunt* is spelled *Sin**ht**gunt* (emphasis added). In the 19th century, [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\") stuck strictly to this reading, proposing a complex compound based on Germanic *\\*Sin-naχt-gund*, i.e., \"the night-walking one\".\\[[2]\\](#cite_note-2 \"#cite_note-2\") As a result of the pairing with Sunna, the personified sun (corresponding to Old Norse [Sól](</wiki/S%C3%B3l_(Germanic_mythology)> \"Sól (Germanic mythology)\")), this etymology has been interpreted as a reference to the [moon](/wiki/Moon \"Moon\"). However, this reading has yielded problems; the moon in Germanic mythology is considered masculine, exemplified in the personification of the moon in [Norse mythology](/wiki/Norse_mythology \"Norse mythology\"), [Máni](/wiki/M%C3%A1ni \"Máni\"), a male figure. According to [Rudolf Simek](/wiki/Rudolf_Simek \"Rudolf Simek\"), the historical record lacks evidence for any cult of personified celestial bodies among the ancient Germanic peoples.\\[[3]\\](#cite_note-3 \"#cite_note-3\")\n\nStefan Schaffner rejects this etymology, as does [Heiner Eichner](/w/index.php?title=Heiner_Eichner&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Heiner Eichner (page does not exist)\") \\[[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiner_Eichner \"de:Heiner Eichner\")\\], because the first element *Sinht-* cannot be based on the presupposed earlier Germanic *\\*sinχt-*. Such a Germanic form would have yielded Old High German *\\*sīht* by regular sound change.\\[[4]\\](#cite_note-4 \"#cite_note-4\") The amended *Sinthgunt* presupposes a Proto-Germanic compound *\\*Senþa-gunþjō*, the first element meaning \"raid, (military) campaign\", the second one \"fight\". This interpretation corresponds well to other Old High German female names such as *Sindhilt* (from *\\*Senþa-χilðijō*, with its second element also meaning \"fight\", cf. [Old Norse](/wiki/Old_Norse \"Old Norse\") *hildr*, [Old English](/wiki/Old_English \"Old English\") *hild*).\\[[5]\\](#cite_note-5 \"#cite_note-5\") Simek also mentions the interpretation \"heavenly body, star\".\\[[6]\\](#cite_note-SIMEK285-286-6 \"#cite_note-SIMEK285-286-6\")\n\n## Placement\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Placement\")\\]\nThe figures [Fulla](/wiki/Fulla \"Fulla\") (*Uolla*) and [Frigg](/wiki/Frigg \"Frigg\") (*Friia*) are attested together in later Old Norse sources (though not as sisters), and theories have been proposed that Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. This notion has resulted in a theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of Sinthgunt and Sunna/Sól, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.\\[[7]\\](#cite_note-BOSTOCK29-7 \"#cite_note-BOSTOCK29-7\") Similarly, [Wolfgang Beck](/w/index.php?title=Wolfgang_Beck&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Wolfgang Beck (page does not exist)\") \\[[de](<https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_Beck_(Germanist)> \"de:Wolfgang Beck (Germanist)\")\\] analysed her as a subordinate goddess from Sunna's retinue, a kind of \"situation goddess\", based on her unique appearance in the sources.\\[[8]\\](#cite_note-8 \"#cite_note-8\")\n\n[Friedrich Kauffmann](/wiki/Friedrich_Kauffmann \"Friedrich Kauffmann\") classified Sinhtgunt as a [valkyrie](/wiki/Valkyrie \"Valkyrie\") in the 19th century, because the elements *-gund* and *-hild* appear frequently in their names.\\[[9]\\](#cite_note-9 \"#cite_note-9\") Stefan Schaffner and Heiner Eichner more recently agreed with him, based on Günter Müller's paper on the valkyries' healing powers.\\[[10]\\](#cite_note-10 \"#cite_note-10\")\n\n[Karl Helm](/wiki/Karl_Helm \"Karl Helm\") rejected Kauffmann and grouped Sinhtgunt with the [Idisi](/wiki/Idisi \"Idisi\") of the [First Merseburg Charm](/wiki/First_Merseburg_Charm \"First Merseburg Charm\"), as a specially defined group of Germanic goddesses.\\[[11]\\](#cite_note-11 \"#cite_note-11\")\n\n## Notes\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sinthgunt&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Notes\")\\]\n\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-ORCHARD112_1-0 \"#cite_ref-ORCHARD112_1-0\")** Orchard (1997:112).\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-2 \"#cite_ref-2\")** [Sophus Bugge](/wiki/Sophus_Bugge \"Sophus Bugge\"). *Studien über die Entstehung der nordischen Götter- und Heldensagen*.
